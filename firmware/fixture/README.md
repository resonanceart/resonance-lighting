# fixture -- production fleet firmware

One image for all four fixture classes (downlight / perimeter / trunk /
chandelier), extracted from the proven bench sketches. The current code/NVS enum
still calls the trunk role `uplight`; treat that as a compatibility name until the
manifest/schema rename is coordinated (ADR 0032). `net_bench` remains the desk
**bridge** build (master + serial bridge); this sketch is peer-only.

## Cambium direct control

`NB_DIRECT_FRAME` (type 25) carries up to 18 addressed RGBW entries per ESP-NOW
packet. A fixture renders only the entry matching its three-byte short MAC. Frames
grant an expiring micro-lease; after one second of silence the last color fades to
half, and after three seconds the fixture returns to its autonomous program with the
existing crossfade. `NB_FORCE_LIFECYCLE` (type 26) provides RAM-only day/night/auto
bench control and never survives reboot. The local power tier and night gate still
outrank requested colors.

The nominal 130-light fleet requires eight broadcast packets per complete color
wave. At Cambium's intended 8 Hz rate that is 64 packets/s, below the previously
exercised ESP-NOW rate range. The Nevada City acceptance bench uses perimeter
fixtures `F3FD88`, `F2BE80`, and `F2BFEC`.

## Architecture stance

**Cooperative main loop + ISR-enqueue rx queue + esp_timer one-shots. No
application FreeRTOS tasks.** This deviates from ADR 0005 deliberately: it is
the only architecture with field hours behind it (net_bench soaks), and the
conservative reading of ADR 0028 rule 3 (no power-management-bus I2C from
core-0-pinned tasks under WiFi) plus the 2026-07-29 blocking-driver lesson
(cooperative TMF8820 one-shot machine; presence_bench's core-0 task quarantine
is forbidden on this bus). All Wire1 traffic runs at 100 kHz from loop context.
Revisit tasks only if render jitter is measured, and never for power-bus I2C.

> 2026-07-30 amendment (ADR 0028 addendum): rule 3 is downgraded -- the sealed
> A/B + 46 h soak both ran power-bus I2C from a core-0 task at 100 kHz, so the
> clock, not core placement, is the load-bearing rule. A single-owner sensor
> task (presence_bench shape, ALL Wire1 in one task) is now permitted pending
> a pre-playa field soak. Motivation is measured art quality: sensor-to-LED
> latency drives how alive the demo feels, and loop bursts visibly stutter
> max-speed orbit/spiral. Peer-to-peer CA impact TBD. The cooperative loop
> stays the shipping architecture until a task build earns its field hours.

## Build / flash

```
./build.sh                          # compile only
./build.sh --port /dev/ttyACM0      # USB flash
./build.sh --ota <ip>               # OTA via POST /update
./build.sh --artifact-dir build/r1  # stable artifact for fleet_usb_bringup.py
./build.sh --channel 11 --profile commission
./build.sh --channel 11 --profile commission --basic-listener
./build.sh --wifi-source <gitignored-header> --solenoid-test  # targeted bench image
```

Always `-DPOWERFEATHER_BOARD_V2=1` (build.sh injects it). Chemistry is
build-time (`--chem lfp` default); everything else is runtime NVS.
`--solenoid-test` is deliberately not a fleet option: it forces the arm bit and
relaxes only the daytime solar-surplus gate while retaining the night and FULL-
tier battery vetoes. Use a named artifact and a specific peer.

Rev-2 solarnoid SW1 shares D7 with the MCU through a hardware one-shot. An armed
fixture releases D7 to INPUT/high-Z between strikes. After observing a released
LOW, firmware accepts one external rising edge and extends it to the same bounded
40 ms pulse as the PowerFeather USER button; another strike requires release and
a new edge. Boot-high/stuck-high inputs do not fire or retrigger, normal MCU
requests refuse an already-high external line, and the timer plus loop failsafe
remain authoritative. External edges are ignored during OTA maintenance.

The default battery-side charge-current ceiling is 2,000 mA (ADR 0033). The
BQ25628E may deliver less because of input-current/voltage regulation, source
capability, system load, CV taper, or thermal regulation. `G<ma>` remains an
explicit lower override for a smaller or otherwise limited cell.

Bringup: `fleet_usb_bringup.py commission --sketch-dir fixture --build-path
firmware/fixture/build/<r> --expect-fw <version> ...` -- the serial/HTTP
contract (`t` JSON keys, `u` + "maintenance WiFi up, ip=" banner, /telemetry,
/resume, /update) is preserved byte-for-byte from net_bench.

## Sensor-domain recovery

Every non-parked boot gives the separate VSQT/STEMMA rail a verified 100 ms
off -> on cycle before class probing. This matters on OTA and warm resets because
PowerFeather otherwise preserves the RTC-held rail state, allowing a stale TMF
firmware/ranging state to survive the MCU reset. `Board.enableVSQT()` is retried
and GPIO14 is read back for both transitions; Wire1 remains fixed at 100 kHz.

The normal TMF timeout path still performs the cheap cooperative stop/start.
Three consecutive failed measurement cycles escalate once per boot to a full
VSQT cycle and reconstruction of the SparkFun driver, which forces TMF init,
open, firmware upload, application-mode switch, configuration, and ranging
start. MSA311 and BMP581 are reinitialized because they share the rail. Further
failures stay degraded rather than flapping the domain. Telemetry exposes
`tmf_domain_resets` in addition to reads/errors/recoveries.

Commissioning likewise treats `tmf8820_present=true` plus zero reads as a
recoverable state: it performs one `S1` timed-sleep/VSQT reset and retests before
failing. `tmf8820_present=false` does not get that retry and remains the signal
to inspect the module, first cable, and power contacts.

## Serial commands (peer)

`t` telemetry JSON | `u` local ENTER_MAINT | `c` resume | `C<mah>` capacity
(reboots) | `G<ma>` charge cap | `K<id>:<ms>` solenoid (gated) | `S[<s>]`
deep sleep | `O<0-4>` class override | `F<0|1>` profile dev/prod | `N<0|1|2>`
force day/night/auto | `L0` force LED rail off until `L1` or reset | `L1` clear
the override and run the bench smoke render | `X` guarded bare-board
PROTECT clear | `r` status line

`X` works only with verified good USB/VDC, no plausible battery, charging off,
and no charger fault. It does not clear PROTECT automatically or over ESP-NOW;
`fleet_usb_bringup.py` uses it only in the default battery-absent workflow.

## NVS (namespace `resfx`)

`cap_mah` `chg_ma` `chg_policy` `class_ovr` `class_last` `fc_stage` `boots` `profile`
`batt_tier` `dim_mv/off_mv/slp_mv` `sol_en` `maint_v10` `channel`
`channel_policy` `night_max`.
The USB command `H<1..13>` persists a new ESP-NOW channel and reboots so the
radio is cleanly re-pinned; bare `H` reports the current channel.
First boot migrates `netbench:{cap_mah,chg_ma}` and carries a parked
`fc_led_stage` (production must not un-park a protected unit). Charge-policy v1
then replaces legacy 500/1,000/1,500 mA NVS values with the 2,000 mA default
once. A nonstandard pre-existing value is preserved as a possible deliberate
cell limit; later `G<ma>` overrides remain persistent.

Channel 11 is the production default. Channel-policy v1 migrates an absent key
or the historical channel-6 fallback to the compiled channel (11 for production)
once, while preserving any other explicit lab channel. Later `H<1..13>` choices
are marked current and remain persistent.

## Commission vs field profile

`PROFILE_DEV=0` retains its wire/NVS value for compatibility but is now the
operator-facing **commission** profile. It is the pre-build/build-week posture:
the ESP-NOW control plane stays awake, heartbeats run at 1 Hz, solar current does
not trigger a lifecycle transition, and bridge command leases are the only
artistic authority. No command (or a stale/expired command) means electrically
dark with the LED rail off -- never an automatic CA fallback. A genuinely
critical battery still parks all loads; its commission-mode retry is 60 s, and a
verified external source keeps the parked control plane awake for service.

`PROFILE_PROD=1` is the operator-facing **field** profile: 300 s/15 s day-charge
duty cycle (energy-gated), 0.2 Hz hb-short, scheduled/autonomous behavior, and the
normal 900 s PROTECT sleep. Local power and solenoid safety vetoes are identical
in both profiles; commission changes reachability and fallback behavior, not load
safety. Flip via `NB_PROFILE` (type 21) or per-unit serial `F` (`F0` commission,
`F1` field). New build flags accept `--profile commission|field`; `dev|prod` remain
compatibility aliases.

The supervised `--basic-listener` posture is deliberately minimal. With no
active bridge lease, every fixture holds steady red at linear level 128. A
bridge command overrides it, and stale-command fallback returns to red within
three seconds. LED channel values are sent linearly: 0 is off, 128 is dim, and
255 is the 8-bit bright endpoint. There is no gamma correction, boot salute,
external-supply carousel, identity pop, or local sensor-created color. The old
`--quiet-autonomy` option remains only as a build-script alias for existing
commands and selects this same basic posture.

Maintenance exit clears the ESP-NOW receive queue before reinitialization, so a
queued maintenance command cannot replay after `/resume`. If radio initialization
fails during the WiFi-to-ESP-NOW transition, the fixture remains in COMMS posture
and retries once per second until `espnow_up=true`. Telemetry exposes
`espnow_up`, `comms_init_attempts`, `comms_init_failures`, `led_rail_on`, and
`smoke_render` so an operator can distinguish radio recovery, command receipt,
power veto, and physical LED output.

## OTA rollback

`verifyRollbackLater()`/`verifyOta()` are `extern "C"` -- the weak hooks live
in a C file; a mangled C++ override silently never runs. Deferred self-test at
t+20 s (power chip, gauge sanity, mode-appropriate network path, NVS, watchdog)
marks the image valid or reboots into rollback. COMMS requires ESP-NOW plus a
completed send; MAINT requires associated WiFi plus the active OTA HTTP server
because ESP-NOW is deliberately down there. Drill: flash a
`--ota-fail-selftest` build over OTA
and watch it revert unattended. Rollback support requires one full USB flash
to install the current bootloader config (the M1 fleet reflash provides it).
Telemetry exposes `ota_partition`, `ota_address`, `ota_state`, and the legacy
`ota_pending_verify` boolean so same-family A/B transitions remain observable.

## Hardware-gate checklist (owed before fleet flash; see plan)

- [ ] `fleet_usb_bringup.py --sketch-dir fixture` full commission incl. --wifi-check
- [ ] appears on an UNMODIFIED net_bench serial-bridge master + dashboard
- [ ] per-class render smoke from one binary (probe log + `O` override + RGBW order)
- [ ] bench-supply power matrix: 3.00 dim / 2.95 off+OTA window / 2.90 sleep;
      PROTECT survives POR/WDT/SW reset; compound release only; retry once
- [ ] OTA good-image valid + fail-selftest auto-revert on battery
- [ ] GH wave on the 2x10 rig via pinned adjacency (RSSI-mode A/B for the record)
- [ ] commission bridge lease grant plus command-loss hard dark/rail-off <= 5 s
- [ ] commission time-to-maintenance <= 10 s; field worst case one sleep period
- [ ] 24 h outdoor prod soak: dusk, bounded night (set night_max low to prove
      it fires), dawn, maintenance reachable in every state, night strike refused
