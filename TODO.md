# TODO

Active punch list. Status: `[ ]` open, `[~]` in progress, `[x]` done. Owner in parens.

## Immediate documentation / repo hygiene

- [x] **Fix fixture OTA self-test for maintenance-mode verification -- DONE
  2026-08-15.** A healthy
  `fx-260816-railoff-b` OTA on `F40364` entered maintenance with ESP-NOW
  deliberately down, then failed the unconditional `espNowUp/sendOk` predicate
  at t+20 s and rolled back. `otafix1-b` now uses the radio posture appropriate
  to the active mode (ESP-NOW in COMMS; associated maintenance WiFi/HTTP readiness
  in MAINT). Good-image acceptance and distinct `otafail-b` forced rollback both
  passed on battery-backed `F40364`; see LOG (Ben/Codex).
- [x] **Expose OTA partition identity in fixture telemetry -- DONE 2026-08-15.**
  Added running partition label/address and string image state. The canary trace
  explicitly showed accepted `app1`, failing `app0`, then rollback to `app1`.
  Distinct artifact version strings supplied the build identity (Ben/Codex).

- [x] Add `LOG_APPEND_2026-05-10.md` entry to `LOG.md` -- **DONE 2026-06-08**: merged 05-10 + 05-11 entries into `LOG.md`; staging files (`LOG_APPEND_*`, `DROP_IN_INSTRUCTIONS.md`) removed (Ben/Claude).
- [x] Add ADR 0015 -- PowerFeather V2 as COTS/reference architecture -- **DONE** (`docs/decisions/0015-powerfeather-v2-cots-reference.md`) (Ben).
- [x] Add ADR 0016 -- COTS prototype shortlist -- **DONE** (`docs/decisions/0016-...`) (Ben).
- [x] Add ADR 0017 -- Battery cell format and sourcing -- **DONE** (`docs/decisions/0017-...`) (Ben).
- [x] Add/rewrite ADR 0018 -- LED module/interface plan. **DONE 2026-06-04**: IS31 ruled out for the V2 battery build; direct-GPIO LED path established (Ben/Claude).
- [x] Add ADR 0022 -- mixed LED fleet by optical role. **DONE 2026-06-17**: HEX for close-range animation / glow; 4 W RGBW point source for long-throw crisp gobo. Placement/type mix remains open below (Ben/Codex).
- [x] Add `docs/research/COTS_SURVEY_2026-05-10.md` -- **DONE** (exists) (Ben).
- [x] Add `docs/research/POWERFEATHER_V1_V2_SCHEMATIC_NOTES_2026-05-10.md` -- **DONE** (exists) (Ben).
- [x] Add `docs/tests/COTS_BENCH_TEST_PLAN_2026-05-10.md` -- **DONE** (exists) (Ben).

## COTS purchasing / arrival

**2026-07-08: the live procurement record is `ops/PROCUREMENT.md`** (orders ledger,
to-buy queue, lead-time risks). Items below are follow-ups, not the ledger.

- [x] Buy R&D candidate set: PowerFeather, FeatherS2 Neo, Atom Matrix, NeoHEX, Adafruit IS31FL3741 matrix, DFR0559, panels, battery samples (Ben).
- [x] Contact PowerFeather creator re: V2 availability and KiCad files (Ben).
- [ ] Follow up on PowerFeather forum thread if no reply within a few days (Ben).
- [x] Confirm whether Elecrow boards are V2 or V1 on arrival -- **DONE 2026-06-02**: V2.R2 confirmed on the bench (Ben).
- [ ] Confirm whether PowerFeather V2 KiCad/Gerbers can be shared or licensed (Ben).
- [x] ~~Call/email BatterySpace re: 18650 LiFePO4~~ -- **SUPERSEDED 2026-07-08**: production cell is the fullbattery 32700 6 Ah (ADR 0025). BatterySpace returns only as the 20 Ah #6832 candidate below (Ben).
- [x] ~~Buy alternate LiFePO4 18650/26650 sources~~ -- **SUPERSEDED** by ADR 0025 (175x 32700 bought) (Ben).
- [x] ~~Confirm Elecrow batch-2 invoices AND ships 2026-07-10~~ -- **ORDERED
  2026-07-09 as 90 boards** ($3,494.24 incl. s&h/bank fee/tariff); spares risk
  resolved (158 production boards total) (Ben).
- [ ] Track pf-batch-2 (90 boards) CN transit; chase the rep if no tracking by
  ~07-16 -- must land before the ~Jul 20-31 TN trip / Aug 1 parts-on-hand line (Ben).
- [x] ~~Place the JST-XH harness order~~ -- **DONE ~2026-07-12/13, in deliberate
  abundance across multiple vendors** (lead-time hedge): 300x 10 cm red/black
  (Keszoox) + 1,800x multi-length/color (AliExpress) + 160x 5-pin Y-splitters +
  60x PH pigtails + receptacle/header smalls, ~$575 total (Ben).
- [x] ~~Buy hat enclosures~~ (was implicit in the hat plan) -- **BOUGHT
  ~2026-07-12/13: 172x COTS enclosures + screws** ($5,306.50; 111 large for
  downlights, 61 small for perimeter/candidate trunk-light use; 22 to TN,
  150 to CA). Record vendor/part details in `ops/PROCUREMENT.md` (TBC) (Ben).
- [ ] Confirm Polycase counts on receipt (current mapping, ADR 0032: LARGE ->
  72 downlights; SMALL -> 24 perimeter + up to about 16 trunk lights, leaving
  healthy inventory headroom). Set aside the 2 transparent-lid demo units
  (1 large + 1 small) for show-and-tell (Ben + Steve).
- [ ] **Lock the trunk-light build** for about 16 fixtures: compare 4 W RGBW with
  the smaller lensed 3 W RGB module for throw, appearance, draw, heat, and mounting;
  then select the power, enclosure, optic protection, and attachment hardware
  (Steve + Ben).
- [ ] Receive + count the 2026-07-07 orders (MSA311/STEMMA, VL53L5CX, ToF covers, TMF8820-mini, 100x 6 Ah) as they land; update `ops/PROCUREMENT.md` statuses (Ben).
- [ ] Buy JST-XH right-angle headers + pre-crimped harness set (LED/battery wiring, ADR 0029 fat conductors) once counts firm (Ben).
- [x] ~~Buy Grove breakout(s) for the HEX HY2.0 connector adaptation~~ -- **DONE,
  twice over: 70x RobotShop 2026-06-18 (shipped to Steve, order recovered from
  memory 07-12) + 55x Electromaker 2026-07-10** ($64.86 + $85.26; 125 total) (Ben).
- [x] ~~Buy USB cabling + panel-mount USB-C ports~~ -- **ORDERED 2026-07-10, and
  bigger than planned: 150x waterproof panel-mount USB-C extension cables** ($540
  portion of an $860.34 Adafruit order) -- the rescue/charge port goes on EVERY
  fixture, not just solar-free classes (Ben).
- [x] ~~Order the RGBW top-up~~ -- **DONE 2026-07-10: 50 more** ($247.50, same
  order) -- 150 RGBW total, spares healthy at any chandelier mix (Ben).
- [ ] Hat design: gasketed USB-C port cutout on ALL four hat variants (part on
  hand once the 07-10 order lands) (Steve).
- [ ] Source ~100 JST 2-pin Y-cables (~$0.50 each found; verify quantity availability) -- CONDITIONAL on the RGBW VBAT-feed decision (Ben).
- [ ] Commit `enclosure/references/DOWN LIGHTS DRAWINGS.pdf` to the repo, or re-point the three references to its actual home (Ben/Steve).

## Camp network and field infrastructure

- [ ] **Configure the Beryl AX on arrival and verify channel 11 over the air
  (ADR 0036).** 2.4 GHz fixed to channel 11, 20 MHz width (HT20), WPA2-PSK, on a
  dedicated SSID separate from 5 GHz. Do not accept the config page as proof --
  confirm with a scan (phone analyzer or the bridge `NB_SCANAP` path) that the
  SSID reports `ch=11`. Push laptops and phones to the 5 GHz SSID. Full runbook
  in `docs/howto/CAMP_NETWORK_SETUP.md` (Ben).
- [ ] **Rehearse Starlink bypass mode at home before the event (ADR 0036).**
  Leaving bypass mode requires a factory reset, so the undo must be known rather
  than discovered in the field. **Dish generation resolved 2026-08-15: Gen 3 +
  Gen 4 on hand (possibly all Gen 4), Ethernet built in, no Starlink Ethernet
  Adapter needed.** Remaining: confirm the port physically on the unit that
  travels and that bypass mode is present in its app settings (Ben).
- [ ] **Prove simultaneous WiFi-plus-mesh coexistence on the pinned AP.**
  Associate one device to the channel-11 SSID while a fixture beacons and
  confirm ESP-NOW RX continues both directions for at least an hour. Then
  deliberately set the AP to channel 1 and confirm the guard behavior: WiFi
  dropped, mesh retained, mismatch surfaced (Ben/Claude).
- [ ] **Implement the ADR 0036 channel guard in any firmware that associates
  while using ESP-NOW.** After STA association, read the actual operating
  channel; on mismatch with the compiled mesh channel, drop the association and
  keep the mesh, then surface it on display or serial. Does **not** apply to
  fixtures in OTA maintenance mode, which have already left ESP-NOW by design.
  No current firmware needs this yet -- it lands with the first
  mesh-plus-internet device (Ben/Claude).
- [ ] **Run one parallel shared-WiFi OTA over the Beryl**, not just a house
  network, using the normal targeted `U<id>` + `field_cycle_ota.py` path. Do not
  build or use the deprecated per-board maintenance-AP fallback (Ben/Claude).
- [ ] **Measure the Beryl's actual draw** powered the way it will actually be
  powered (USB-C off the camp battery, not a wall wart) and record it against the
  camp energy budget. Nominal is about 5 W; confirm rather than assume (Ben).
- [ ] **Resolve one virtual SSID across the camp and art-site Starlinks.** Both
  APs must be on channel 11; if both are to serve OTA they must also share SSID
  and PSK. Previously queued against the production credential work; now also
  gated by ADR 0036 (Ben).
- [ ] **Claude mesh bridge handheld -- decide whether to build at all (ADR 0037).**
  Direction and corrected design brief are recorded in
  `docs/research/CLAUDE_MESH_BRIDGE_DESIGN_2026-08-15.md`; nothing is committed.
  **Hardware is on hand (2026-08-15): 2x LilyGO T-Deck Plus (LCD) + 1x M5Stack
  Cardputer ADV.** Board is settled -- T-Deck Plus first (two units means a
  spare, plus the larger display and better keyboard), Cardputer ADV port after,
  behind the display/input HAL. Do **not** port from T-Deck Pro documentation --
  the Pro is a different device (e-paper, CST328 touch, TCA8418 keypad) whose
  drivers do not transfer. Two milestone-0 measurements before any real build,
  both cheap and both able to kill the concept: put a test pattern on the panel
  in direct sun with sunglasses, and measure continuous-census runtime on the
  2000 mAh cell (this repo measured an always-on ESP-NOW peer at about 168 mA
  radio-RX-dominated, LOG 2026-06-08, so expect well under a night). If runtime
  forces radio duty-cycling, the census must distinguish "node was quiet" from
  "I was not listening". Remaining decision: how
  class/spatial targeting works, since no group addressing exists on the wire
  (start with client-side expansion from the census; a class byte or named
  groups would need their own ADR). Non-negotiables if it is built: include
  `firmware/fixture/src/core/packet.h` rather than defining a second protocol
  header, build the census on the ordinary ESP-NOW receive callback rather than
  promiscuous mode, keep OTA/reboot/profile opcodes off the tool surface, and
  clamp actuator parameters in firmware. Post-2026-event unless re-prioritized
  (Ben).

## COTS bench testing

- [~] **P0: finish the basic-listener OTA on the seven outstanding fixtures.**
  The 2026-08-16 rollout put `fx-260816-otafix1-b` on 25 of the 32 eligible
  previously seen fixture IDs. `F2BE0C` and `9E5A84` were subsequently
  overwritten by an active external OTA writer with Elliot's
  `fixture-2026-08-15.7`; `9F275C`, `F3FD88`, `F2BE20`, `F2BE48`, and
  `F2BEE4` remain on older images. Do not reopen fleet maintenance until the
  other Cambium/OTA daemon is stopped or isolated. Then reacquire the seven
  through the normal shared-WiFi path and require the target revision plus OTA
  state `valid`. Classify newly seen, unrostered `.7` peer `9F26D8` before
  deciding whether it belongs in the light-fleet scope. Converted solarnoid
  `9E5B8C` remains excluded from this light-only image (Ben/Codex/Elliot).
- [ ] **Add a single-writer interlock for shared-WiFi OTA.** This is distinct
  from deliberately leaseless lighting control. On 2026-08-16 another host
  replaced accepted firmware on `F2BE0C` and captured `9E5A84` while Ben's
  maintenance hail exposed them on the LAN. Immediate runbook: one active OTA
  daemon/operator at a time. Follow-up: choose an authenticated/allowlisted OTA
  owner or another mechanism that prevents a second host from POSTing an image
  to a maintenance fixture; document recovery and takeover semantics before
  the next unattended fleet update (Ben + Elliot + Justin).
- [ ] **Reproduce the fleet bulk-direct color test.** The accepted `F40364`
  canary obeyed targeted direct colors, and the 2026-08-16 fleet obeyed a
  60-second broadcast-identify blue blink, proving radio RX and LED rendering.
  However, a rapid host loop of per-fixture direct blue/off commands was not
  visually observed across the fleet even though the bridge reported every
  transmit successful. Re-test with one sustained canonical multi-entry frame,
  inspect `direct_seen`/`direct_matched` on a maintenance canary, and separate
  host pacing/addressing from interference by the second controller (Ben/Codex).
- [x] **Canary the basic supervised listener before any fleet OTA -- DONE
  2026-08-16.** Candidate
  `fx-260816-f2bb4cd-b`, channel 11, default commission, SHA-256
  `c792d8c28e8a9c57a0e19455394a5b19c161030cdcf016d741001b672797f965`.
  With no bridge lease it must hold steady red at linear level 128. Commands use
  direct linear 0..255 values; stale direct control returns to red within three
  seconds. Gamma, boot salute, supply carousel, identity pop, and local ToF color
  are absent. Hard battery/rail/OTA rollback protection remains. First prove on
  one USB canary: red persists with every bridge/controller stopped; black and
  primary-color commands obey; stopping frames restores red; RMT survives an
  explicit rail off/on cycle. Then OTA one battery-backed canary, wait beyond the
  20-second pending-verify window, verify the exact revision and fresh heartbeat,
  and only then expand to five supervised fixtures. **2026-08-15 USB canary is
  now on the positively identified COM46 / `F40364`: exact revision, healthy
  PowerFeather/battery/charging, channel-11 ESP-NOW, LED rail, three sensors, and
  no pending OTA verify all passed. Steady red after USB removal passed, and a
  handshake-gated targeted Cambium command changed only `F40364` to solid blue
  with bridge TX success. Black, green, blue, dedicated white, stale fallback
  to red, true rail off/on with post-cycle breathing, reset directly to red,
  good-image acceptance, and forced-failure rollback all subsequently passed.
  The accepted fleet artifact is `fx-260816-otafix1-b`; see LOG (Ben/Codex).
- [x] **Fix Cambium one-shot serial command readiness -- DONE 2026-08-15.** The older local CLI
  starts its asynchronous COM connection and can call `send_identify()` before
  the transport is connected. The transport correctly drops stale/not-connected
  frames, but the CLI prints `identify ...` as if it succeeded. Require a bridge
  STATUS handshake before one-shot mutations and surface not-ready/drop as a
  failure. A persistent handshake-gated retry advanced COM43 TX success and
  made the same targeted blue command work. Fixed from Elliot's latest branch in
  Cambium branch `origin/codex/serial-ready-gate`, complete at `078071c`: require
  fresh STATUS, stamp the real bridge ID, wait for the USB write, then hold the
  port until STATUS reports `tx_ok`/`tx_fail`. The committed CLI passed the live
  targeted-blue proof on `F40364`; 349 tests pass, 1 skipped (Ben/Codex; ready
  for Justin/Elliot review).
- [ ] **Make USB target identity a pre-flash interlock.** The first basic-listener
  attempt selected COM43 from Windows arrival time and temporarily overwrote the
  CoreS3 Cambium bridge instead of COM46 / `F40364`; the bridge was rebuilt,
  restored, and verified. Require a matching live board/firmware identity or a
  physical-reset uptime correlation before upload. Never use COM arrival time as
  sufficient identity when more than one USB device is attached (Ben/Codex).
- [ ] **Throttle or latch repeated LED rail-on failures.** When PowerFeather
  initialization is unavailable, the basic listener currently asks for its red
  frame each loop and `renderTick()` retries the impossible rail enable at loop
  speed, flooding serial. Keep the rail parked but retry at a bounded service
  cadence and expose a counter/last result in telemetry (Ben/Codex).
- [ ] **Run and save a full-cadence census before classifying the missing deployed
  lanterns.** Old field firmware uses 300-second ordinary day sleeps and
  900-second PROTECT sleeps. Listen at least 16 minutes without resetting/opening
  the bridge midway. A powered PROTECT peer should still timer-wake and send setup
  heartbeats; a peer still absent is more likely unpowered, in BMS cutoff, or out
  of range. Record every seen ID and last battery/supply/reset fields, then use the
  panel-mount rescue USB only for the residual set (Ben/Codex).
- [ ] **Qualify a load-armed boot marker before relaxing conservative reset
  escalation.** Commission liveness fixes the impossible 60-second PROTECT
  release and makes false escalation serviceable, but the durable boot-stage guard
  can still treat certain clean POWERON resets as repeated load failures. Design a
  wear-safe marker that distinguishes "reset while LED/solenoid load was actually
  armed" from panel-first/no-battery/bench power ordering, then run the full
  battery/panel/USB ordering matrix before changing the field safety ladder
  (Ben/Codex).

- [~] **Productionize reduced-access Atom Matrix campmate clickers for 2026.**
  Direction: distribute simple Atom Matrix + Atomic Battery Base mini-bridges
  instead of prioritizing 433 MHz receivers this year; keep the wide-input
  dry-contact receiver retrofit as an open fallback. First proof
  `atom-clicker-2026-08-09.1` is USB-flashed on Atom `54AD9C` (COM42), fixed to
  channel 11, target `9E5B8C`, and a 40 ms type-17 strike. Its only runtime
  control is the pressable 5x5 face; it requires release, debounces, rate-limits,
  and exposes no WiFi/OTA/serial/fleet configuration commands. Remaining:
  physically confirm one press -> one strong strike; inventory/source Atom
  Matrix units and 200 mAh Atomic Battery Bases; measure runtime and implement
  button-wake/deep-sleep; define target provisioning, labels, charging, and
  lost-device revocation; add authenticated/authorized strike commands because
  the current ESP-NOW packet is unauthenticated; add honest actuator ACK/feedback;
  and test multi-clicker coexistence, coverage, cooldown, and abuse behavior
  against the production fleet (Ben/Codex).
- [ ] **P0: quarantine the RX480E dock on all fabricated solarnoid v2.0 boards.**
  First bring-up on 2026-08-09 smoked two receivers. The ordered PCB assigns
  HT7550-1 pin 2 to P5V and pin 3 to VBOOST, but Holtek specifies SOT-89
  1=GND, 2=VIN, 3=VOUT. Do not install another receiver. With RECVR empty,
  `+V`-to-`G` measured **11.76 V**, confirming boost-rail overvoltage. Choose and
  qualify an ECO: leave/depopulate U1 for receiver-free production, cross-wire
  VIN/VOUT, or use a separately powered wide-input dry-contact receiver harness
  (KR1201MINI2-V05B is the leading 31 x 14 x 7 mm candidate). Do not use the
  damaged P5V pad as an improvised 12 V source. A new board revision
  must correct the nets and pass loaded 5 V measurement before release. Treat
  the two smoked receivers as quarantined/e-waste, not retest candidates
  (Ben/Codex).
- [ ] **Spot-check the receiver rail on the 24 boosted rev-1 outer-ring
  downlights before lid closure.** These are rev-1 capboards with the external
  approximately 12 V boost spliced into capboard VDC/GND. Rev 1 correctly routes
  its AMS1117-5.0 (unlike the fabricated rev-2 HT7550 fault), and Ben reports the
  populated 433 MHz receiver paths working. On representative units, verify P5V
  remains near 5 V under receiver load and confirm U1 stays acceptably cool in
  an extended powered test; record the receiver current and test duration
  (Ben).
- [x] **P0 before closing the 24 outer-ring downlights: USB-reflash the production
  maintenance credential.** Binary inspection on 2026-08-09 found that the exact
  Aug-8 `fixture-2026-08-08.1` artifact embeds retired `WonkyHouse`, not the
  `BubbyNet` profile previously recorded. Production peers must use the exact
  case-sensitive `Party In The Woods` SSID and will never use WonkyHouse or
  BubbyNet. Rebuild one locked fleet artifact, inspect its strings/flags, then use
  each fixture's already-required final USB pass to flash and verify all 24 before
  lid closure. **DONE 2026-08-10: 24/24 complete** on locked
  `fixture-2026-08-10.1`; all five batches include live Party maintenance
  verification. `9E5B8C` also passed a deliberate rescue-USB reflash with its
  production LFP installed, replacing its temporary solenoid-test image. Future:
  validate one virtual SSID across the BM camp
  and art-site Starlinks when that network exists (Ben/Codex).
- [x] **Harden TMF8820 boot and runtime recovery before lid closure -- DONE
  2026-08-10 in `fixture-2026-08-10.2`.** On
  2026-08-10, `F40268` passed TMF ID detection and driver `begin()` but produced
  zero measurements with 22 timeout/recovery cycles while downstream MSA311 and
  BMP581 stayed healthy; a PowerFeather reset alone restored 223 clean reads with
  no cable movement. At boot, perform a verified VSQT off/on cycle before class
  probe/sensor initialization so USB/OTA resets cannot inherit stale sensor state.
  After a small bounded number of consecutive ranging failures, escalate beyond
  stop/start to one full TMF or VSQT reinitialization, then report degraded rather
  than flapping the shared rail. Update commissioning to retry one reset when
  `tmf8820_present=true` but reads remain zero; reserve cable intervention for an
  absent ID or failure after the reset retry. Keep Wire1 at 100 kHz (Ben/Codex).
  Firmware now verifies a 100 ms VSQT off/on cycle before every non-parked class
  probe, escalates three consecutive TMF failures to one full shared-domain and
  driver rebuild per boot, and reports `tmf_domain_resets`. Native recovery
  policy coverage passes; commissioning gives the present/zero-read signature
  one `S1` rail-reset retry but never retries an absent ID. Hardware proof:
  `F2B7DC` entered OTA on `.1` with TMF present, zero reads, and rising errors;
  the `.2` boot produced 298 clean reads, zero errors, and healthy MSA/BMP. The
  exact artifact OTA-passed all four connected downlights after an LFP was added
  to `F2B7DC` for ride-through; its repeated bare-USB power losses correctly
  triggered A/B rollback rather than leaving a partial image.
- [x] **USB-commission all 24 BMP-equipped outer-ring downlights -- DONE
  2026-08-08:** final units `F2BEA4`, `F40384`, `F2BDB0`, and `9F0E54` pass the
  locked image/configuration and complete sensor gate. `F40384` required a local
  TMF STEMMA connection repair and cold boot, then held zero TMF errors. Registry
  count is 24/24 commissioned outer-ring units; six BMP581s remain spares and
  quarantined `F2BE74` is excluded (Ben/Codex).
- [x] **USB-commission production downlight batch 4 -- DONE 2026-08-08:**
  `F40268`, `F2BF54`, `9E668C`, `F2BE8C`, and replacement `F2BF5C` pass the
  locked image/configuration and three-sensor gate. Original fifth PowerFeather
  `F2BE74` is quarantined after two TMFs/cables reproduced its loaded sensor-rail
  fault; do not install a battery in it. The BMP-equipped outer hanging ring is
  now 20/24 commissioned (Ben/Codex).
- [x] **USB-commission production downlight batch 3 -- DONE 2026-08-08:**
  `F2BEE4`, `9F26AC`, `F2BE0C`, `9F26E4`, and `F3FC90` passed the locked
  image/configuration and three-sensor gate on the first attempt. The
  BMP-equipped outer hanging ring is now 15/24 commissioned (Ben/Codex).
- [x] **USB-commission production downlight batch 2 -- DONE 2026-08-08:**
  `9F26BC`, `9E5A84`, `9E5B8C`, `F2BE20`, and `F2BF8C` pass the same locked
  image/configuration and three-sensor gate as batch 1. A replacement STEMMA
  cable restored `9E5A84`'s initially failing TMF8820 without reflashing. The
  BMP-equipped outer hanging ring is now 10/24 commissioned (Ben/Codex).
- [x] **USB-commission the first five production downlights -- DONE
  2026-08-08:** `F40364`, `F2B7DC`, `9E5A94`, `9F275C`, and `F2BE48` all pass
  exact-artifact upload and sustained serial acceptance on
  `fixture-2026-08-08.1`, production/channel 11, Generic_LFP 15,000 mAh,
  2,000 mA charge limit, and 4.6 V VINDPM. Each auto-classified as a
  downlight and returned healthy MSA311, TMF8820, and BMP581 samples with zero
  TMF errors. The artifact credential was later proven to be `WonkyHouse`, not
  the `BubbyNet` label recorded at commissioning; correction is queued above.
  Evidence and artifact hash are recorded in `LOG.md` (Ben/Codex).
- [x] **Qualify 24-board production USB commissioning through the two powered
  Sabrent hubs -- DONE 2026-07-27:** Windows enumerated 24 unique PowerFeathers
  simultaneously through the Anker USB-C adapter. All 24 are registered and pass
  ESP32-S3/8 MB flash/2 MB PSRAM preflight, exact-artifact USB upload, PowerFeather
  controller telemetry, bare-board charging-off safety,
  live 6 Ah LFP profile, and BubbyNet OTA/resume. A post-commission hold/census kept
  all 24 present with zero present USB devices in an error state. This qualifies one
  24-fixture bare-board intake batch. The completeness follow-up also enumerated,
  registered, and commissioned all 26 hub ports with zero present USB errors.
  Two independent 12-way upload/serial runs and one 12-way upload plus four-wide WiFi
  run passed; 12 flash workers / 4 WiFi workers is the qualified production setting.
  This does not qualify simultaneous battery/LED loading. **TN credential migration
  DONE 2026-07-27:** all 26 passed USB flash + serial verification on uniform peer
  `net-bench-2026-07-27.3`, WonkyHouse profile, channel 11, and guarded D7 support.
  WonkyHouse was not visible from the CA bench, so all 26 initially remained
  `ota_verified=false`. **FIRST TN NETWORK PASS 2026-07-29:** enclosed peer `F2BFA0`
  was heard over ESP-NOW, targeted into maintenance, joined WonkyHouse at observed
  DHCP address `10.0.0.200`, served matching `/telemetry`, accepted `/resume`, and
  rejoined ESP-NOW. Its registry row is now verified; repeat in sensible batches for
  the other 25 as they are assembled (Ben/Codex).
- [~] **Qualify hub-powered indoor VDC operation before enclosure/solar availability:**
  use a USB-A-to-C cable from a switched Sabrent port into the existing female
  USB-C-to-XH breakout, with only V+ -> VDC and GND -> GND. With all power off,
  confirm XH polarity and about 5 V before connecting; install the already-profiled
  LFP battery only while unpowered. Start with one board at `maintain_v=4.6` and the
  ADR 0033 2 A battery-side ceiling, verify `supply_good`, input voltage/current,
  `battery_present`, and `charging_enabled`, then scale 1 -> 4 -> 12 -> 26 while
  checking hub/cable temperature and brownouts. Do not override source detection or
  IINDPM beyond the measured per-port capability, and avoid a high LED load until
  that capability is measured. This validates indoor
  power/charging and fleet firmware, not panel MPP, shade, dusk, or energy harvest
  (Ben/Codex). **ONE-BOARD PASS 2026-07-27:** `F4044C` ran with PowerFeather USB
  disconnected and hub power entering VDC/GND. Telemetry showed a present 3.39 V
  6 Ah LFP, charging enabled, about 4.80 V / 472-474 mA input, and `supply_good`.
  Targeted shared-WiFi OTA completed in 4.03 s with no button press, and the guarded
  D7 solenoid path recorded two 40 ms strikes while the supply remained good. Ben
  confirmed both produced physical kicks. Remaining: scale 1 -> 4 -> 12 -> 26,
  inspect temperatures/brownouts, and measure the 10-port hub's per-port margin.
- [~] **Finish DFR0991 local-solenoid-button validation on P126 `9F2690`:** firmware
  support is OTA-deployed in `net-bench-2026-07-16.3`, but the first post-OTA probe
  reported `present=false`/address 0. Verify the Gravity PH2.0-to-STEMMA adapter has
  3V3/GND/SDA/SCL in the correct order and is seated on the PowerFeather STEMMA/Wire1
  connector. Yellow -> SCL and blue -> SDA are confirmed; next measure red/black at
  the button while VSQT is awake and inspect the female Dupont contacts. **Power is
  now confirmed at 3.3 V on the button board.** One 3.33 V `brownout` occurred during
  the post-reseat maintenance catch but likely came from accidentally bridging 3V3/GND
  with meter probes. Next, with power removed, continuity-check yellow -> C/SCL and
  blue -> D/SDA and verify neither data line is shorted. Then wake/reset the peer,
  confirm telemetry detects `0x23`-`0x2A`, and
  physically validate one 40 ms D7 strike per press/release. Do not claim the I2C
  trigger proven until that press test passes (Ben/Codex).
  **2026-07-16 `.4` diagnostic:** power and continuity pass; the module ACKs at `0x2A`
  (`ack_mask=0x80`) but returns PID `0x0000` after seven delayed probes instead of
  `0x43DF`. Next measure INT-to-GND at 3.3 V idle/pressed. If INT toggles, wire it to a
  confirmed-free 3.3 V GPIO and use a debounced digital trigger; if not, isolate/test
  or replace the module. Do not apply 5 V to the live ESP32 I2C/INT lines.
  **TN observation 2026-07-29:** enclosed `F2BFA0` also has the baseline `0x2A` /
  PID `0x0000` probe result seen in bare-board fleet records, so that result does
  not prove an external DFR0991 is attached. Remote D7 strike and USER/GPIO0 paths
  are healthy, but no supported external I2C button was detected. Keep the original
  `9F2690` module/INT diagnosis separate.
- [~] **Physically validate the SparkFun PRT-27576 Qwiic Navigation Switch DOWN
  trigger on P126 `9F2690`:** opt-in `--solenoid-d7` firmware probes PCA9554 addresses
  `0x20`-`0x27` read-only, accepts the expected five input/non-inverted switch bits,
  and maps debounced active-LOW DOWN/GPIO1 to the normal guarded 40 ms strike. Confirm
  telemetry presence/address, one strike per DOWN press/release, no repeats while
  held, maintenance suppression, and normal field-cycle sleep/rejoin. INT is
  deliberately unused, so this is an awake-only trigger; USER remains the wake path.
  (Ben/Codex).

- [x] **Make field logging outage-safe -- DONE 2026-07-17:** `net_bench_log.py` now
  exclusive-creates by default and refuses an existing output before binding/listening.
  `--append` validates the first/last JSON rows, inherits the original run identity, and
  writes a numbered resume boundary; `--overwrite` is the only destructive mode. Every
  new data row carries its segment index/start timestamp. Five focused tests cover
  create/refuse/resume/malformed-tail/overwrite behavior. A fresh seven-day P105/P126
  segment is live at `ops/bench/data/ca/2026-07-17-ca-field-cycle-9F26F8-9F2690-
  weather-range-r2.jsonl`; dashboard and logger restart commands are documented in the
  net-bench README. The July 15 Windows Update reboot exposed the old failure (Ben/Codex).
- [ ] **Retain the previous completed field-cycle summary across sunrise:** current
  firmware resets cycle Ah/Wh/min/max at `fieldCycleStartNewCycle()`. If the host is
  absent across dawn, the exact completed-night endpoint is gone by reconnection even
  though RTC counters survived the outage. Snapshot the previous cycle number, phase
  durations, charge/discharge Ah/Wh, min/max VBAT, peak powers, DIM/PROTECT/reset
  outcome, and completion reason before reset; expose it in heartbeat/telemetry with a
  validity marker. Avoid per-second NVS writes (Ben/Codex).
- [ ] **Implement and qualify sparse GPS/RTC time anchors plus scheduled shows
  (ADR 0031):** production direction is deterministic site/date UTC start/stop, not
  panel-current consensus. Four SAM-M8Q modules are already bought as GPS soft anchors
  for absolute UTC, and four Adafruit DS3231 STEMMA modules with backup batteries are
  already bought as initial RTC holdover anchors. Distribute source/age/uncertainty
  over ESP-NOW so all roughly 130 fixtures do not need time hardware. Qualify the SAM-M8Qs
  through the real hat/panel/battery geometry and the DS3231s across temperature,
  reset, and backup-power cases; select final anchor counts; measure acquisition
  energy, RTC drift/backup current, and local-clock holdover; define schedule
  versioning, safe slew/correction, POR and partition recovery, and the
  invalid/stale-time fallback. Remove Starlink/host and pass one compressed plus one
  real overnight scheduled cycle before production use. Keep the SAM-M8Q
  autolocation/true-north benefits in the same anchor plan rather than treating the
  four receivers as separate inventory. (Ben/Codex).
- [~] **P105 production-harness A/B of `net-bench-2026-07-13.2`:** remove the external
  panel/battery INAs and instrumented interconnects, but leave firmware, cell, panel,
  load, and thresholds unchanged for the first complete dusk/show/recovery cycle.
  Compare ramp and steady-state sag against the July 13 roughly 500 mA / 2.93 V FULL
  and 300 mA / 3.07-3.09 V DIM points. Confirm at most one DIM retry, durable rail-off
  park after any second reset, and no false sunrise from a missing TSL2591 sample. If a
  reset persists on production wiring, investigate BQ/BATFET disconnect evidence before
  moving thresholds. P105 remains 4.6 V VINDPM; P126 remains 5.8 V (Ben/Codex).

- [ ] **Production low-battery policy hardening and qualification:** execute the plan
  in `docs/tests/SOLAR_FIELD_CYCLE_P105_P126_2026-07.md`: replace the one-sample +20 mA
  PROTECT release with sustained charger/current/voltage recovery, fix and validate the
  coulomb integrator, derive loaded compensation per production electrical class and
  cold boundary, run the deterministic POR/OTA/I2C/transient matrix, and complete a
  multi-day field acceptance cycle. Preserve default-off rail sequencing, durable
  FULL/DIM/PROTECT stages, and the one bounded DIM retry (Ben/Codex).

- [x] Build interim Track A0: Adafruit Feather ESP32-C6 + Adafruit IS31FL3741 13x9 matrix via STEMMA-QT until PowerFeather boards arrive (Ben).
- [x] Build interim Atom + Atomic Battery Base + M5Stack Unit NeoHEX stack over Grove (Ben).
- [x] Flash USB smoke-test firmware to Adafruit Feather ESP32-C6, FeatherS2 Neo, and Atom Matrix; record MAC, reset reason, board type, firmware version, and LED/I2C status (Ben).
- [x] Install/check smoke-test Arduino libraries: Adafruit IS31FL3741, Adafruit GFX, Adafruit BusIO, and a WS2812-capable LED library for integrated 5x5 boards (Ben).
- [x] Decide first OTA maintenance-mode mechanism for COTS smoke firmware: local WiFi AP credentials vs board-hosted temporary AP/web updater (Ben).
- [x] Test home-WiFi web OTA upload end-to-end on all three COTS smoke boards (Ben).
- [ ] Test temporary AP / portable-router OTA upload path before field-style testing (Ben).
- [x] Repeat low-battery OTA boundary test on the shared-WiFi parallel OTA path, not
  per-device maintenance AP. First maint-AP attempt 2026-06-29: at ~2.57 V the peer
  entered/attempted maint-AP, then brownout-reset and emitted only two heartbeats at
  ~2.33 V before going stale. Second attempt 2026-06-29: at ~2.95 V the peer left
  ESP-NOW after `U`, but no reachable AP/shared-WiFi IP was found and no OTA upload
  occurred; then `9E5AB8` was USB-flashed to known shared-WiFi `net-bench-2026-06-29.3`.
  `net-bench-2026-06-29.5` adds maintenance-entry power preflight telemetry, immediate
  comms resume on OTA-start failure, and watchdog feeds during upload; re-test should
  use shared-WiFi/parallel OTA to measure the real lower-voltage bound. `mt=2` is an
  advisory power warning by default, not a hard block. Follow-up attempt 2026-06-29:
  local `wifi_secrets.h` was stale (`Brandon Springs Activity Guest`) while the laptop
  was on `BubbyNet`, and peer `9E5AF0` exposed `ResonanceMaint-9E5AF0`, proving an old
  maint-AP image was still present. No AP OTA was used. `9E5AB8` rebooted by task
  watchdog during maintenance entry around 3.02-3.03 V loaded, then was USB-flashed on
  COM4 to known-clean `.5` with BubbyNet shared-WiFi secrets and no `ResonanceMaint`
  string. `9E5AF0` was then USB-flashed on COM6 to the same known-clean `.5` BubbyNet
  non-AP image; boot banner confirmed direct `COMMS (ESP-NOW)`, and a WiFi scan showed
  no `ResonanceMaint-*` SSID. Both live peers are now clean for the next true shared-WiFi
  OTA test. **DONE 2026-06-29 official test:** both peers entered shared-WiFi maintenance
  on BubbyNet and accepted parallel `net_bench_ota.py --reboot comms` uploads to
  `net-bench-2026-06-30.1`; `9E5AB8` succeeded from about 3.10 V loaded (INA about
  3.10 V, below advisory floor) and `9E5AF0` from about 3.27 V loaded. Both rejoined
  ESP-NOW with `reset_reason=software`, no button, no AP SSID. Treat ~3.10 V loaded as a
  proven-success lower bound, not a final production cutoff. Soften prior interpretation:
  the earlier 2.95-3.03 V failures were wrong-path/pre-upload failures with stale WiFi
  secrets, AP-contaminated firmware, and/or pre-`.5` watchdog behavior; they do **not**
  prove low VBAT was the root cause (Ben/Codex).
- [ ] Bracket the true low-VBAT OTA boundary on the current shared-WiFi path with
  historical confounders removed. Use known-good WiFi secrets, no deprecated
  `NB_MAINT_AP` images, targeted `U<id>` / `field_cycle_ota.py` maintenance discovery,
  and explicit pre/post voltage plus supply state. Record separate brackets for:
  battery-only/no-supply, solar/VDC-assisted, and USB-assisted. Current clean
  successes: about 3.10 V loaded battery-only, 2.901 V solar-assisted, and 2.496 V
  USB-assisted. Current lower-voltage "failures" around 2.57 V, 2.95 V, and
  3.02-3.03 V are pre-upload/wrong-path/stale-secret/AP-contaminated data, not clean
  OTA voltage cutoffs (Ben/Codex).
- [x] Add a targeted shared-WiFi maintenance command (`U<id>` or dashboard peer action)
  so a single-peer OTA does not pull every awake peer off ESP-NOW. **DONE 2026-06-30
  in `net-bench-2026-06-30.6`:** the bridge accepts `U9E5AB8`-style sustained targeted
  maintenance, peers handle `NB_TARGET_ENTER_MAINT`, and the dashboard `Peer maint`
  button sends `U<selected-id>`. Bare `U` remains available for deliberate fleet wake
  and for first-hop migration of older peers that cannot parse the targeted packet
  yet (Ben/Codex).
- [x] Harden the targeted `U<id>` OTA workflow so a fresh image cannot be immediately
  recaptured by the still-sustained maintenance command after reboot. Candidate fixes:
  host-side OTA helper waits for the 35 s `U` window to expire before upload, or firmware
  adds a one-shot targeted-maintenance guard after a software OTA reset. Gotcha observed
  2026-07-03 on `9F26F8`: OTA succeeded, first heartbeat appeared, then the peer was
  caught back into maintenance by the command tail. **DONE 2026-07-05 for the recommended
  scripted path:** `ops/bench/field_cycle_ota.py` waits out the 35 s targeted-maintenance
  tail before invoking `net_bench_ota.py --reboot comms`; direct manual dashboard OTAs
  should use the helper or wait out the tail by hand (Ben/Codex).
- [x] Add a host-side maintenance discovery helper for targeted sleeping-peer OTA:
  after sending `U<id>` through the bridge, scan the shared-WiFi subnet for `/telemetry`
  with the matching `fixture_id`. Once a peer leaves ESP-NOW for WiFi maintenance, the
  dashboard cannot learn or display its IP through the serial bridge; this added manual
  scan step was needed for the 2026-07-05 `9F26F8` v5 OTA. **DONE 2026-07-05:**
  `ops/bench/field_cycle_ota.py` scans auto-discovered local /24s plus `192.168.4.0/24`
  and matches `/telemetry` by `fixture_id` before upload (Ben/Codex).
- [ ] After a few more bench/field passes, extract the reusable OTA workflow primitives
  from `ops/bench/field_cycle_ota.py` into a small shared module for future firmware and
  deployment tooling: targeted maintenance command retry, fixture-ID `/telemetry`
  discovery, command-tail wait, OTA upload invocation, and post-reboot rejoin
  verification. Keep `field_cycle_ota.py` field-cycle-specific until production
  software needs the shared path (Ben/Codex).
- [x] ~~Build Track A: PowerFeather V2 + LiFePO4 + solar panel + Adafruit IS31FL3741 matrix~~ -- **SUPERSEDED: IS31 ruled out** (shared-bus brownout, 2026-06-04). LED axis -> SK6812 HEX direct-GPIO (Ben).
- [~] Build Track B: PowerFeather V2 + LiFePO4 + solar panel + direct-GPIO LED --
  **the leading path**. LED brownout-safety validated; ADR 0022 selects a mixed
  HEX + 4 W RGBW fleet by optical role. Remaining: solar sizing, type mix/placement,
  enclosure, and production connectorization (Ben).
- [ ] Build Track C: FeatherS2 Neo + DFRobot DFR0559; Feather battery JST left empty (Ben).
- [ ] Build Track D: Atom Matrix + DFRobot DFR0559 (Ben).
- [ ] Run incoming inspection and board-ID procedure from COTS test plan (Ben).
- [ ] Measure sleep current for each stack (Ben).
- [ ] Measure active/radio/ESP-NOW current for each stack (Ben).
- [~] Measure LED current for center-only, 3-pixel, 9-pixel/crop, and full-array capped modes -- LARGELY DONE 2026-06-11 via `/set?n=` + `ops/bench/hex_ramp.py` (INA ground truth, HEX): single px 41.8 mA full, count-ramp safe to n=10 @ full (288 mA) / n=37 @ val 64 (261 mA) on the bench LFP -- the ceiling is battery sag, see LOG 2026-06-11 (Ben).
- [ ] Add SEN0291 I2C wattmeters to power-test harness and bench worksheet when they arrive (Ben).
- [ ] Run iso-current LED brightness/gobo comparison from `docs/tests/ISO_CURRENT_LED_BRIGHTNESS_TEST_2026-05-18.md` (Ben + Steve).
- [ ] Measure solar charge behavior for each 1-5 W panel in sun/shade/heat (Ben). Next
  outdoor run: Voltaic P105/P126 ETFE prep in
  `docs/tests/VOLTAIC_ETFE_PANEL_TEST_PREP_2026-06-15.md`.
- [~] Test low-battery + solar recovery for PowerFeather V2 and fallback stacks.
  **PowerFeather V2 solar-only OTA path validated 2026-06-30:** `9E5AB8` recovered from
  low VBAT on panel-only charge, crossed the watcher threshold at 2.901 V, entered
  shared-WiFi maintenance via one last bare `U` from `.4`, accepted OTA to
  `net-bench-2026-06-30.6`, rebooted/rejoined without a button, and resumed field-cycle
  telemetry. Remaining scope: characterize full day/night cycle behavior and repeat/port
  any needed checks on fallback stacks if they stay in contention (Ben/Codex).
- [x] Flash outdoor solar peer `9E5AB8` to current targeted-control net_bench peer image
  -- **DONE 2026-06-29**: USB-flashed `net-bench-2026-06-29.3`, shared-WiFi maintenance
  path, LFP/6000 mAh/1500 mA, channel 11, 1 Hz heartbeat (Ben/Codex).
- [x] Flash the USB bridge/master to current net_bench after it is plugged back in
  -- **DONE 2026-06-29**: first reflashed COM7 as `.3` serial bridge
  (`NB_SERIAL_BRIDGE=1`, channel 11, 1 Hz default frame rate) and verified selected-peer
  `G9E5AB8:1500`; later reflashed COM7 to `.4` with the solar guard, watchdog-safe
  WiFi-join loops, 96-byte ESP-NOW receive buffer, and bridge/peer firmware-rev dashboard
  telemetry (Ben/Codex).
- [ ] Compare outdoor recovery at `R1` versus targeted `P9E5AB8:3600` solar naps now
  that the outdoor peer has targeted nap support (Ben).
- [ ] Test standard OTA maintenance mode on at least two COTS boards (Ben). Current `.3`
  peers exposed a maintenance-entry watchdog problem before any upload: the 20 s shared-WiFi
  join loop can trip the 8 s task watchdog. Fixed in `.4`; `.5` also feeds the watchdog
  during upload and reports low-power maintenance-entry warnings before dropping ESP-NOW.
  At least one peer still needs USB flash or a successful quick-join OTA before fleet OTA
  can be considered healthy.
- [~] Test ESP-NOW heartbeat/state packets with jitter/sequence numbers -- prototyped + bench-validated on 1 board in `firmware/net_bench/` (broadcast heartbeat w/ seq + jitter, per-source seq-gap PDR). Multi-node matrix pending (see Networking feasibility below) (Ben).
- [ ] Test LED fail-safe: stuck LEDs, MCU hang, watchdog reset, rail-off recovery (Ben).
- [ ] Test remaining production-relevant gobo/filter variants with HEX and 4 W RGBW
  point-source modules; keep older IS31/NeoHEX/FeatherS2/Atom data as historical
  fallback context only (Ben + Steve).
- [ ] Test-print the 50 mm bamboo-leaf aperture in `enclosure/gobo-templates/`, photograph
  its projection through the lantern rig, and widen slots if the slicer closes them (Steve).
- [ ] RF test each candidate inside a mock hat with panel/battery/wiring installed (Ben + Steve).
- [ ] Time-trial COTS stack assembly into mock hat (Ben + Steve).
- [~] Capture NeoHEX passive adapter Rev A in KiCad from `hardware/led-adapter/neohex-passive-rev-a/` design packet; PCBA-friendly starter PCB exists, schematic remains (Ben).
- [x] Replace NeoHEX adapter through-hole connector candidates with SMT PCBA-friendly candidates: local M5Stack A118 HY2.0-4P SMD footprint for J1 and stock SMT JST-PH for J2 (Ben).
- [x] Add J5 JST-SH/STEMMA-QT fallback output for Adafruit 4528-style Grove-to-STEMMA-QT cable on NeoHEX adapter Rev A (Ben).
- [x] Prepare PCBWay quick-turn PCBA upload packet for NeoHEX adapter Rev A (Ben).
- [~] Revise PCBWay NeoHEX adapter assembly quote to DNP J1/A118 and build through J5 fallback output (Ben + PCBWay).
- [ ] Physically verify NeoHEX adapter J1 A118 candidate footprint against M5Stack Grove/HY2.0 cable and confirm pin order before ordering (Ben).
- [ ] Physically verify NeoHEX adapter J5 fallback output with Adafruit 4528-style Grove-to-STEMMA-QT cable and confirm signal lands on J5.4 (Ben).
- [ ] Verify J2 SMT JST-PH power connector against selected pre-crimped power leads, or swap to SMT JST-GH if preferred (Ben).
- [ ] Capture NeoHEX passive adapter schematic in KiCad and back-annotate the PCB from it (Ben).
- [ ] Order NeoHEX passive adapter Rev A quick-turn boards and record fab/shipping turnaround (Ben).

## PowerFeather power-bench (2026-06-02, board 9E5AB8 -- see docs/tests/POWER_BENCH_HARNESS_2026-06-02.md)

- [x] Stand up Arduino power-bench firmware `firmware/power_bench/` with SDK 2.1.0 telemetry + `/telemetry` JSON (Ben).
- [x] Confirm V2 hardware via Wire1 scan: MAX17260 (0x36), BQ25628E (0x6A), IS31 (0x30) (Ben).
- [x] `Board.init(4400, Generic_3V7)` Ok; battery/supply voltage + current read correctly over WiFi (Ben).
- [x] Wire up IS31FL3741 13x9 on the STEMMA-QT bus (Wire1, GPIO47/48) shared with the SDK (Ben).
- [x] Host logger `ops/bench/power_logger.py` + `power_summary.py` + site-partitioned JSONL data layout (Ben).
- [x] Resolve MAX17260 SOC/health/cycles `InvalidState` -- root cause was the missing `-DPOWERFEATHER_BOARD_V2=1` compile flag (SDK fell back to V1 LC709204F gauge); now in build.sh + #error guard. SOC/health/cycles/time_left populate (Ben).
- [ ] Verify BQ25628E charger telemetry: state, faults, input regulation, charge current (Ben).
- [x] Add NeoHEX + single-RGBW LED build variants on bench -- DONE: `--led neohex/rgbw1/neodriver`, `--pixel-pin` to drive WS2812/SK6812 direct on any free GPIO (used A0/GPIO10) (Ben).
- [~] Solar harvest sweep across panels/conditions; set `RES_PF_MAINTAIN_V` to panel MPP -- STARTED 2026-06-08: path validated on the Seeed 3W panel + LFP (net-positive ~10 mA charge even in partly-cloudy-through-glass @ 0.37W, VINDPM steady at 5.5V). Remaining (do on USB so reflash is safe): full-sun board-asleep harvest number + **`--maintain` sweep (5.5/5.0/4.6) for the shaded canopy** (lower VINDPM may harvest more when the panel sags) (Ben).
- [x] **Outdoor solar telemetry over ESP-NOW + WiFi range diagnostic -- BOTH DONE 2026-06-08** (LOG cont. 7/8/9): plan `docs/tests/SOLAR_TELEMETRY_RANGE_PLAN_2026-06-08.md`. Next: a **sizing-oriented** solar run (below).
  - [x] **(b) WiFi 2.4GHz coverage diagnostic -- DONE + hypothesis SETTLED 2026-06-08** (LOG cont. 7+9). Wireless ESP-NOW bridge (no laptop tether), doubling as (a)'s infrastructure: net_bench `--serial-bridge` + `--scan-report` (`NB_SCANAP`), host `net_bench_serial_bridge.py` + `net_bench_log.py` `nb-scanap` rows; `firmware/wifi_diag/` = the complementary tethered probe (unused -- scan route sufficed). **Conclusion (high confidence):** the ESP32 latches one Eero BSSID and doesn't auto-roam; carried outdoors it clings to the weak indoor node while a -46 dBm nearer one sits available -> drop. **It's a moving-board artifact; deployed fixtures are stationary -> low field risk.** Logged as a gotcha (POWERFEATHER_NOTES) + firmware-guard TODO below. A formal yard-walk coverage-at-distance map is **optional/deferred** (the question is answered) (Ben).
  - [x] **(a) Solar telemetry over ESP-NOW -- BUILT + VALIDATED on hardware 2026-06-08** (LOG cont. 8). Heartbeat carries `supply_mv`/`supply_ma`/`supply_good` (append-only, `NB_PROTO_VER` unchanged) -> `nb-peer` `sv=/sma=/sgood=` -> `net_bench_log.py` derives `supply_w`/`battery_w`/`load_w` into JSONL. Validated: panel V/I logs over ESP-NOW with no WiFi-STA; revealed a dark-panel (`supply_v=0.123`, traced to a reseated connector) cause for the earlier net-discharge. **Note:** the bench `load_w` is the diagnostic firmware's draw, NOT a fixture budget -- still need the bottom-up nightly budget (see Field reliability TODO) before sizing the cell/panel (Ben).
  - [~] **Sizing-oriented solar campaign** -- in progress 2026-06-08 (LOG cont. 10). Spec cell (LFP mAh) + panel (W) from harvest (Wh/day at MPP) vs load (sleep + LED show). Progress + open items:
    - [x] **Supply telemetry + idle floor** -- always-on ESP-NOW peer = **~168 mA/0.55 W** (radio-RX-dominated; scanning negligible) -> unsustainable on battery, **deep-sleep mandatory**.
    - [x] **Sleep-cycle firmware** (`--sleep-cycle`) + **`U` fleet wake-for-maintenance** (no-touch OTA of a sleeping board) -- both validated on hw.
    - [x] **`SET_MAINTAIN`** runtime VINDPM (MPP-sweep + P&O-MPPT actuator).
    - [x] **LFP drawdown -- ABORTED as redundant** (LOG cont. 11): the 2026-06-03 reboot-loop drain already has the LFP curve (mean -145 mA, SOC 92->30 %, flat ~3.25 V). **Capacity: UNCONFIRMED** -- the 06-03 drain delivered >=617 mAh but stopped *mid-plateau* (not empty), on an un-learned gauge, so SOC-derived capacity is unreliable on LFP's flat curve. Likely a normal ~1-1.5 Ah 18650 LFP; the earlier "~1000 mAh / overrated 2x" was too strong (walked back). Needs a clean full->empty coulomb run + learned gauge / the INA meter (Ben).
    - [ ] **Clean full->empty capacity run** (USB top-up to full first, coulomb-count) to confirm the real LFP capacity (~1000 mAh?) -- gating for battery sizing (Ben).
    - [x] **Sleep-cycle idle drain -- rails were the culprit** (LOG 2026-06-09). Cutting both 3V3 rails (`enable3V3(false)+enableVSQT(false)`) in deep sleep dropped idle ~1.7->0.5 %/h (~3-4x, ~20->5 %/night); INA ground-truth in the battery lead shows the rails-OFF duty-cycled drain is **sub-mA** (the gauge over-read it on the flat LFP plateau). **Idle is negligible (ground-truth). Sizing is LED-show- + harvest-bound.** Gotcha captured in POWERFEATHER_NOTES (Ben).
    - [x] **External ammeter -- BUILT: 4-channel INA219 monitor** (`firmware/ina_monitor/`, Adafruit Metro S3 + 4x SEN0291 @ 0x40/41/44/45, separate-monitor topology; since 2026-07-02 also runs on the KB2040 with optional VEML7700/TSL2591 lux). Reads a board-under-test's current through deep sleep, gauge-independent. **Next:** (a) **fast-sample capture** (raise rate) to nail per-wake energy -- 10 Hz may miss a <100 ms radio-init spike; (b) **calibrate R_shunt** (0.1 ohm provisional; raw shunt_mV logged so recoverable); (c) wire **panel-lead + LED-rail** channels for the full power-flow map; (d) sharpen sleep resolution (drop PGA range); (e) **I2C robustness (2026-07-02): clear a channel's present flag after N consecutive ERRs, and attempt bus recovery (9 SCL pulses + Wire re-init) when the whole bus errors** -- unplugging the INA harness mid-session wedged the bus (SDA held low) and blinded the still-attached VEML until a reboot (LOG 2026-07-02 audit entry) (Ben).
    - [~] **Clean full-sun MPP sweep -- HOT SESSION DONE 2026-06-11** (LOG 06-11 cont. 2; data `2026-06-11-mpp-sweep-hot-pm-*.jsonl` + knee re-sweep): hot panel (~60 deg C back / 68 deg C front IR) optimum **4.6-4.7 V -> 1.73 W BQ-side / 1.91 W panel-INA ground truth = 3.2x the 5.5 V default (0.59 W)**; instability/knee immediately below 4.6 (one real collapse at 4.4 when stepped to from near-idle); **BQ supply telemetry under-reports harvest ~10 % vs the panel-lead INA** (sizing must use panel-side). Fully wireless: TSL2591 (saturated in full sun -> ir-ch1 normalization fallback, works well; diffuser optional), SHT31 panel-back temp, onboard SEN0291s (0x40 panel / 0x45 battery) all in the heartbeat (fw 2026-06-11.2). **Remaining: the cool-AM session** for Vmp(T) -> the fixed-vs-temp-comp-vs-P&O decision. Lessons baked in: anchor at 4.9 not 5.5 (5.5 is load-noise-dominated); run on a hungry battery (<~50 % SOC -- late-session demand-limiting flattens the curve); approach setpoints from above; beware the bright-sun input-latch on connect (see Firmware guard TODO) (Ben).
    - [x] **Voltaic ETFE P105/P126 outdoor MPP comparison** (2026-06-29, Oakland late sun, both panels about 15 deg tilted): P105 5 W best observed around `m46`/`m48`, panel-side INA about 3.8-3.9 W and charger input about 3.47 W; P126 smaller ETFE best around `m58`, panel-side INA about 1.89 W and charger input about 1.66-1.68 W. P126 is proportionally close to nominal/nameplate; P105 is plausible vs datasheet expected Vmp but may be demand-limited by LFP charge acceptance/taper. See LOG 2026-06-29. (Ben/Codex)
    - [~] **P126 production-cabling perimeter/HEX field cycle** -- deployed 2026-07-10 on former speaker board `9E5B0C`: 2 W panel at fixed 5.8 V VINDPM, 6 Ah production LFP, no INAs/Dupont, and three full-bright R/G/B pixels spiraling in/out at symmetric 120-degree offsets. MAX17260 current and onboard mAh/Wh totals are corrected `/1.08` in firmware. Logger: `ops/bench/data/ca/2026-07-10-ca-field-cycle-9E5B0C-p126-production-cabling.jsonl`; consolidated analysis: `docs/tests/SOLAR_FIELD_CYCLE_P105_P126_2026-07.md`. That original peer was disassembled and retired after a July 13 header-rework hardware failure. Replacement `9F2690` was USB-flashed and safety-verified on `.3` with the same P126 profile; its next phase is the VDC solenoid trial. Treat BQ supply power as end-to-end onboard telemetry, not panel-side ground truth. (Ben/Codex)
      - [x] Quick onboard MPP re-check 2026-07-10: broad optimum at 5.8-6.0 V; 6.0 V showed +3.8% BQ-input W but no battery-current gain, 6.2 V rolled over, and two 5.8 V anchors agreed within 0.4%. Keep the external-INA-qualified 5.8 V fixed setpoint. (Codex)
      - [~] **Fix the nightly show window and active-time integration before sizing:**
        Ben confirmed that the measured roughly 158 mA draw from the three-pixel spiral
        is intentionally representative of a deployed HEX show; do not raise the load
        merely to force a one-night empty. The clean July 11-12 session actually ran
        18:07:33-08:53:54 PDT (14 h 46 min) and logger-time integration gives 2.33 Ah.
        The peer reported only 13.02 h / 2.08 Ah because `fieldCycleIntegrateActive()`
        discards the fractional part of every `dt / 1000` step. Carry milliseconds
        across integrations. **Integrator carry fixed and OTA-deployed to P105
        `9F26F8` in `net-bench-2026-07-14.1`; first live validation passed at RGBW
        turn-on: 178 mAh over 1,535 DRAW seconds = 417.5 mA average versus about
        414-420 mA direct telemetry.** Counters are cycle-total, so subtract the DRAW
        boundary; `field_elapsed_s` alone is phase-local. Separately, the no-lux
        solar-current fallback turns the
        show on well before visual sunset and leaves it on until useful morning input.
        Use a provisional 9-10 h production HEX show window for the next emulation:
        during the Aug 30-Sep 7 event, civil dusk to civil dawn is about 9 h 53 min to
        10 h 15 min at Black Rock Desert. **SEVEN-DAY FOLLOW-UP 2026-07-17 through
        07-24:** the artificial 13-15 h P126 policy consumed about 48.6 Wh while about
        35.0 Wh reached the battery. Normalizing the same week to a scheduled 9-10 h
        show gives roughly 32-36 Wh of load, so the 2 W role was approximately
        break-even, not proven undersized. Future plots must show both as-run and
        schedule-normalized load. **PRODUCTION TRIGGER DECIDED 2026-07-26:** use sparse
        GPS/GNSS plus battery-backed RTC anchors and explicit UTC show windows per
        ADR 0031; implementation/qualification remains open. (Ben/Codex)
      - [ ] Repeat the clean overnight capture after host-power reliability is fixed: the first production-cabling run has a 13 h 04 min laptop-suspend gap (2026-07-10 18:20 -> 2026-07-11 07:25 PDT). Device-retained counters preserve the total, but the overnight time series is missing. (Ben/Codex)
      - [x] **Observe the P126 daily harvest range until this peer is needed elsewhere:**
        leave `net-bench-2026-07-10.1` and fixed 5.8 V in place rather than OTA solely
        to shorten the artificial night. For every additional day, record BQ-input Ah
        and Wh, positive corrected battery Ah/Wh, weather, coverage, and any reset.
        Current complete/provisional weather points are about 1.55 Ah / 9.02 Wh BQ input
        on July 11 and 1.12 Ah / 6.51 Wh through about 18:00 on the overcast July 12.
        The observation ended when Ben disassembled the peer for the next bench on July
        13. The old-board record remains under fixture `9E5B0C`; do not splice replacement
        `9F2690` samples into that fixture history without an explicit run boundary.
        (Ben/Codex)
      - [x] **Paired P105/P126 seven-day weather-range capture -- complete
        2026-07-17 10:18 -> 2026-07-24 10:18 PDT:** the clean 604800 s logger run is
        `ops/bench/data/ca/2026-07-17-ca-field-cycle-9F26F8-9F2690-weather-range-r2.jsonl`.
        Approximate corrected totals were 113 Wh panel input, 94 Wh positive battery
        charge, 102 Wh load, and -8 Wh battery net for P105; P126 measured 52 Wh panel
        input, 35 Wh positive battery charge, 49 Wh load, and -14 Wh battery net.
        Neither peer reported an active BQ fault. The P126 result is an intentionally
        severe 13-15 h show, not a production-sizing result: at its observed load,
        scheduled 9-10 h nights normalize to about 32-36 Wh/week versus about 35 Wh
        charged. Preserve both as-run and schedule-normalized views in future analysis.
        (Ben/Codex)
      - [x] **Literal P105 + production RGBW ceiling run -- complete:** OTA-deployed
        `net-bench-2026-07-14.1` to `9F26F8` on July 14 with fixed 4.6 V P105 policy,
        one rail-fed `NEO_RGBW` pixel on A0/GPIO10, `R=G=B=255`, `W=0`, brightness
        255, and all dusk/dawn/load-protection settings otherwise unchanged. The RGBW
        was installed before dusk and drew about 1.35-1.4 W, or roughly 14-16 Wh on
        the long bench nights. Across the seven-day follow-up, P105 supplied about
        94 Wh of positive battery charge against about 102 Wh of load and reached
        protect after the cloudier deficit. Full RGB all night is therefore a useful
        ceiling test, not yet the production show budget; duty cycle and brightness
        still need to be set bottom-up by fixture role. (Ben/Codex)
    - [ ] **Re-run P105 5 W with a hungry larger LFP**: use the 6-7.2 Ah cell intentionally discharged to roughly the mid-SOC voltage region (about 3.25-3.40 V resting, not 3.55+ V while charging), hold around `m46`/`m48`, and confirm whether panel-side power can climb beyond the 3.8-3.9 W seen with the 2 Ah cell. Goal: separate panel capability from cell IR/CV-taper demand limiting. (Ben)
    - [ ] **Analyze 7200 mAh HEX drawdown run before the next P105 test**: data path
      `ops/bench/data/ca/2026-06-29-ca-lfp-7200-hex-drawdown-9E5AF0.jsonl`; record stop
      condition, delivered mAh, final loaded/resting voltage, and whether the 12 h sleep
      preserved the desired hungry-but-not-precharge state. (Ben/Codex)
    - [~] **Prototype simple production MPPT / hill-climb policy**: full sweep on first good-sun boot, then periodic 3-point perturb around the last best VINDPM (`best - 0.2`, `best`, `best + 0.2 V`) during daylight; skip or de-prioritize when battery voltage/current indicate CV/taper or near-full acceptance. **BUILT 2026-07-06 for field-cycle bench v6, not deployed yet:** `--field-mppt` samples fixed P105 candidates 4.6/4.8/5.0 V during charge wakes after the OTA listen window, logs candidate W and skip/run reasons, and clamps back to 4.6 V before sleep/maintenance unless a future `--field-mppt-hold` build is explicitly chosen. Next: flash matching serial bridge first, then OTA peer, then validate candidate powers/wake cost on a sunny day. (Ben/Codex)
    - [ ] **MPPT decision** -- green-lit to *measure*, not yet to commit. After the clean sweep, choose: better fixed setpoint (~4.8-5.0) / temp-compensated Vmp(T) / software P&O (use `SET_MAINTAIN` to hill-climb `supply_W`). Optimum ~ 4.85 V hot vs 5.5 V cool -> a single fixed point can't be optimal across temp (Ben).
    - [ ] Full **0-100 % capacity** drawdown (USB top-up to full first) + buck-boost efficiency vs VBAT on LFP (needs rail-side metering for the latter -- SEN0291) (Ben).
    - [ ] Combine harvest-at-MPP (Wh/day) + load budget + a chosen LED-show profile -> the cell + panel spec; pair with the bottom-up nightly-budget re-derivation (Field reliability TODO) (Ben).
    - [ ] **Analyze field-cycle v2 multi-day run**:
      `ops/bench/data/ca/2026-07-01-ca-field-cycle-9E5AB8-v2.jsonl`. Check whether
      the 18/37px brightness-128 draw load reaches protect nightly, whether the 3.15 V
      soft floor + 30 s debounce avoids one-sample false cutoffs, and whether measured
      panel Wh/day covers the configured night load. Tune thresholds/load after 2-3
      full cycles. (Ben/Codex)
    - [ ] **Capture one clean 24 h solar-cycle dataset before treating field-cycle data
      as sizing-grade**: corrected JSONL logger, laptop disk headroom, stable panel
      placement, lux sensor aimed consistently, and no manual device moves. Goal is an
      uninterrupted sunrise-to-sunrise file with charge peak, taper/full decision,
      night drawdown, and protect/dim behavior all in one comparable run. (Ben/Codex)
- [ ] **Firmware guard: don't enable charging if no battery detected** -- enabling charging into a missing battery (with `maintain` > supply V) browns out / crash-loops on USB. Also: `maintain` must be <= the supply you're powering from (Ben).
- [ ] **Firmware guard: make charger VINDPM/maintain USB-recovery-safe by construction**:
  keep boot default at ~4.6 V, treat higher panel-MPP setpoints as live/test state unless
  a persisted value can be clamped against observed supply voltage. A live `m<v10>`
  command can lower VINDPM only while the peer is still awake/listening; it cannot recover
  a board that already brownout-reset or left ESP-NOW for maint-AP (Ben).
- [x] **Firmware baseline: VBUS_OVP=1 + HIZ-toggle re-qualification kick (bright-sun connect latch) -- IMPLEMENTED 2026-06-29.** Shared helper `firmware/powerfeather_solar_guard.h` now forces BQ25628E `REG0x17[0] VBUS_OVP=1` at charger init and watches for the stuck signature (`supply_v` near panel Voc, `supply_good=false`, near-zero input current) before toggling `EN_HIZ` to synthesize a fresh input-qualification edge. Wired into `net_bench`, `power_bench`, and `led_studio` -- the Resonance sketches that enable PowerFeather charging. Root cause remains the 2026-06-12 datasheet read: low OVP is 6.1/6.4/6.7 V rising; wide OVP is 18.2/18.5/18.8 V; qualification is edge-triggered. **Still validate in bright-sun hardware:** deliberately reproduce the stuck state and confirm the guard clears it without a physical unplug before any panel buy with Voc > 6 V (Ben).
- [x] Clean LED-current runs -- DONE via `--bright-sweep` on battery + `--wifi-lowpower` (steadies the WiFi baseline so small LED currents resolve); the gauge `ima` is the metric, charging masks it so runs are on battery (Ben).
- [ ] Steve mirrors the bench in TN; merge JSONL via the repo (Steve).
- [ ] Add live telemetry readout to `ops/bench/cots-mode-dashboard.html` (Ben).
- [x] Configure LiFePO4 profile on V2 -- DONE: `--chem lfp` (`RES_PF_BATTERY_TYPE=Generic_LFP`) used throughout; LFP favored for safety/heat/cycles (counterpoint = buck-boost crossover tax, see Field reliability) (Ben).

## Battery-brownout investigation (see docs/tests/BATTERY_BROWNOUT_INVESTIGATION_2026-06-03.md -- RESOLVED + UNIFIED 2026-07-03: mechanism class = power-management-bus signal integrity -> BQ25628E power-path register upsets (BATFET/HIZ) -> instant battery-path loss. June's disturbance source = the IS31 chip on the bus; July's = our 400 kHz bus clock. Rules in POWERFEATHER_NOTES; retro-analysis atop the investigation doc re-grades all hypotheses (H2 connectors retired, H3/H4/H5 dead). Remaining open items below are follow-ups.)

- [x] Characterize exact conditions for VSYS power-on reset on battery -- ~~load-stacking~~ ~~not-reproducible~~ **UPDATED 2026-06-04: brownout CAME BACK** -- board 1 did a 794-reboot loop overnight on battery (poweron, healthy bv 3.24-3.46, all SOC, lightest load, dying at WiFi association). Real + intermittent on board 1 => H2 (marginal connection) strengthened. See doc Status (Ben).
- [x] Repeat brownout characterization on a second board + known-good cell -- DONE (n=3 all stable in short runs); **NOW extending: pristine board 2 multi-hour with fixed guard to see if it loops like board 1 overnight (board-specificity)** (Ben).
- [x] Fix the overnight auto-sleep guard -- RAM coulomb/timer state reset every reboot, so a brownout loop defeated it. Added **NVS-persisted reboot-loop breaker** (`--autosleep`, >=25 sub-survival boots => deep sleep before WiFi); fw power-bench-2026-06-04.1 (Ben).
- [x] ~~Inspect/reflow board 1's battery + VDC solder joints~~ -- **RETIRED
  2026-07-03**: H2 (connection impedance) demoted from leading explanation by the
  July root-cause (power-bus signal integrity -> BQ register upsets; identical
  signature reproduced with soldered welded-tab leads on two boards). Board 1's
  identity was also never durably tracked. See the retro-analysis atop
  BATTERY_BROWNOUT_INVESTIGATION_2026-06-03.md (Ben/Claude).
- [x] **Verify the reboot-loop breaker actually fires** -- DONE: board 2 looped and the breaker deep-slept it (validated in the wild) (Ben).
- [x] **FIX loop-breaker brick-risk** -- DONE (fw 2026-06-04.2): (1) **never deep-sleep while external supply is present** (USB/VDC -> stay flashable/recoverable -- the root cause of the stranding); (2) sleep with a **15-min timer wake** (not indefinite); (3) on a timer wake still on battery -> re-sleep, on supply -> run/charge. So plugging USB self-recovers within one wake interval; never bricks. **VALIDATED LIVE 2026-06-04** (3 mAh budget / 60 s wake test): ran on USB w/o sleeping -> coulomb-budget sleep on battery -> 124 s of timer-wake/re-sleep -> recovered (charging, fresh boot) on USB plug, no BOOT+RESET needed. Tuning flags added: `--budget-mah`, `--wake-s` (Ben/Claude).
- [x] ~~Keep a VSYS bulk cap as cheap insurance and bench-characterize it~~ --
  **RETIRED 2026-07-03**: capacitance answers a sag mechanism; the confirmed kill
  class is a power-path switch OPENING (BQ register upset), which no cap prevents.
  Bulk capacitance remains ordinary good design, not a brownout fix (Ben/Claude).
- [ ] Watch for poweron-reset **recurrence in the field** -- through the July lens:
  battery-only `rr=poweron` at healthy voltage = suspect the power-management bus
  first (what shares it, what clocks it), not connectors/cells. Production
  firmware should carry the boot-counter + reset-reason + pre-death-breadcrumb
  telemetry idiom from presence_bench (Ben).
- [x] Distinguish IS31-specific vs any-I2C-device: **NeoDriver (5766, SeeSaw I2C) on the same bus = STABLE** (371 s+, through heavy WiFi) where the IS31 loops in ~1 min => **brownout is IS31-SPECIFIC**, not the bus. NeoDriver+WS2812 is a viable no-solder LED path (Ben).
- [x] ~~Confirm NeoDriver robustness with an hours/overnight run~~ -- **RETIRED
  2026-07-03**: moot; the LED axis went direct-GPIO (ADR 0022) and the standing
  rule is now "nothing optional on the power-management bus" regardless of how
  benign a given device tested (Ben/Claude).
- [x] **Direct-GPIO WS2812/SK6812 validated** (board 2, HEX on A0/GPIO10, off the I2C bus) -- works, brownout-safe by construction, and ~10% MORE efficient than via NeoDriver (no passthrough drop). **Strong candidate for the area/glow role -- but NOT a settled BOM front-runner**: it's roughly tied in viability with the 4 W RGBW point-source, which serves the crisp-gobo role HEX can't, and the efficiency edge is muddied by varying-SOC testbeds. Decide after gobo testing. 3-way plot `led-eff-3way.png` (Ben).
- [ ] **LED bring-up sequencing for production:** WS2812 latch last frame (send explicit all-off to blank); avoid full-white inrush on hot-connect (ramp gently); direct-GPIO's full VCC browns a marginal cell sooner -> cap brightness / healthy pack. **Now quantified (2026-06-11 hex_ramp):** ~350-400 mA LED draw pulls the bench cell to its ~3.0 V brownout edge even at 98% SOC -> production firmware needs a hard current cap = f(brightness x lit-count), scaled to the production cell's IR (the 32700 ~6 Ah cell lifts the ceiling substantially) (Ben).
- [ ] **Qualify the seven-RGB chandelier chain with instruments, not rail
  saturation.** `chandelier-chain-2026-08-11.5` corrects the lensed-RGB model to
  the measured 257 mA/module and defaults to an 800 mA LED budget (seven-pixel
  white cap 113/255; 900 mA supervised maximum). With the production battery,
  log input and rail current, PowerFeather 3V3 voltage, last-pixel voltage/color,
  radio activity, resets, and regulator/connector temperature through an
  extended pattern run. Keep the software current cap: the 1 A rating is shared
  by the board, 3V3 header, and VSQT rail, and saturation is not a safe limiter
  (Ben/Codex).
- [ ] **Decide pixel-power architecture (NeoDriver only level-shifts the DATA signal, does NOT boost pixel power -- corrected; "3-5V vin/vlogic" = accepted *input* range):** pixels run at whatever Vin is. Options + a key power-mgmt axis (software-cuttability):
  - **(a) 3V3 header** -> dim (3.3 V under-volt) but **software-cuttable via `enable3V3(false)`** (free LED kill-switch; can't accidentally drain the pack), zero extra parts. Strong budget default (Ben's pick-direction).
  - **(b) VBAT** -> brighter (<=4.2 V Li-ion) but **always live** -> needs a load-switch/MOSFET + GPIO to be safe.
  - **(c) 5 V boost fed FROM the switchable 3V3** -> **full brightness AND still cuttable** (cut 3V3 -> boost+LEDs die), +1 boost part.
  - Bench-check: does cutting Vin-3V3 kill pixels while the SeeSaw stays alive on STEMMA 3.3 V (ideal: LEDs off, I2C up)? (Ben).
- [ ] **Re-check NeoHEX-vs-HEX efficiency at the actual ship pixel-voltage** (the 1.6x edge was measured at 3.3 V under-volt; SK6812 handles low V better, so the gap may differ at 5 V) (Ben).
- [x] **DECISION: IS31FL3741 13x9 ruled out for the V2 battery build** (shared-bus brownout). Revisit only if the 13x9 grid form factor is a hard requirement (then try VSYS bulk cap or 2nd-I2C-bus GPIO35/36). ~~**Flag ADR 0018 (IS31 primary module) for update**~~ -- DONE, ADR 0018 rewritten 2026-06-04 (Ben/Claude).
- [x] Confirm NeoDriver works powered from 3V3 (dim, under 1 A) on battery -- YES, board 1 stable, no brownout; `--brightness` flag added (Ben).
- [x] **NeoHEX (WS2812C-2020) vs HEX (SK6812) efficiency** -- DONE: **HEX ~1.6x more PAR/mA** (consistent across brightness), so HEX favored for the power budget. Tooling: `--bright-sweep` fw + `ops/bench/led_efficiency_sweep.py` + Apogee SQ-420 PAR sensor. Still TODO: visual **color/dimming** comparison (PAR can't capture it); optional higher-SNR re-run (sensor closer than 6") (Ben).
- [x] **Test single high-power RGBW LED** (Adafruit 5163, 4 W) -- DONE (first pass): brightest + most efficient at high brightness; single point source (-> crisp gobo). At 3.3 V the current curve goes non-monotonic in the mid-range (operating near its Vf) -- but **undervolting is viable (5 V NOT strictly required)** per Ben's prior experience; this run just didn't cleanly characterize its 3.3 V limits. **Open: map RGBW low-voltage behavior properly** (dimming range, color balance, max usable brightness at 3.3 V vs a small boost). `led-par-vs-draw.png` / `rgbw-undervolt.png` (Ben).
- [x] **LED axis decision recorded** -- ADR 0022 accepts a mixed fleet by role: SK6812
  HEX direct-GPIO for close-range animation / glow, and 4 W RGBW point source for
  long-throw crisp gobo. Open work moves to type mix, placement, power budget, and
  boost/current-cap characterization (Ben/Codex, 2026-06-17).
- [x] **Measure LED current vs brightness** -- DONE across NeoHEX/HEX/RGBW/warm-white via `--bright-sweep` + Apogee PAR sensor; full efficiency map in `led-par-vs-draw.png`. (Caveat: confounded by buck-boost efficiency vs SOC -- see Field reliability.) (Ben).
- [ ] Investigate overriding BQ25628E input source-detection to beat the roughly
  500 mA USB input cap (bench convenience only; solar unaffected). Do this only
  for a source with known advertised capability, and never exceed the PowerFeather
  input/connector 2 A rating; ADR 0033's 2 A ICHG ceiling does not itself authorize
  more USB input current (Ben).
- [x] ~~Build a SOLID LFP connection / re-run on solid connection~~ -- **SUPERSEDED**: the brownout turned out IS31-specific (its chip on the shared I2C bus), not the battery connection. The H2-marginal-connection thread is closed (Ben).
- [x] Test LFP full-SOC vs low-SOC under identical load (boost-mode hypothesis H3) -- evidence AGAINST H3: boards ran stable in **active boost** at 3.18-3.24 V (the harder regime), so low-LFP/boost is not the brownout cause (Ben).
- [ ] Run ported demo on battery (firmware/powerfeather_demo_port, AP + ~10 Hz) +/- LED; does the reference app reset? (Ben).
- [x] ~~If resets reproduce on a good connection, add a VSYS bulk cap and re-test
  (H4)~~ -- **RETIRED 2026-07-03**: resets DID reproduce on gold-plated
  connections (July) and the mechanism (switch-opening, not sag) is one a cap
  cannot fix. H4 closed (Ben/Claude).
- [ ] Exercise ported demo web UI: connect phone to PowerFeather_Demo AP -> 192.168.1.1 (Ben).
- [ ] Test `VSQT` off-state leakage with IS31FL3741 attached (Ben).
- [ ] Test `VSQT` sleep/wake/reinitialize cycle (Ben).
- [ ] Test panel MPP/VINDPM settings for each panel (Ben).
- [ ] **Qualify the 103AT battery-thermistor path before relying on unattended 2 A
  charging in sealed hats:** attach it physically to each test cell, verify
  telemetry and BQ JEITA suspend/derate behavior at the production temperature
  bounds, and decide the production sensor/harness plan. Charger-die thermal
  regulation does not measure cell temperature (ADR 0033) (Ben).

## Gobo / aesthetic LED testing (led_studio -- `firmware/led_studio/`, merged from hex_studio/rgbw_studio 2026-06-07)

- [x] Build interactive web app to dial in HEX looks (brightness/RGB sliders, shape rings, spiral/orbit/breathe/twinkle, Split-RGB fringing, Freeze+Step, settings readback) -- DONE, validated on hardware (PowerFeather ACM1, HEX pin 10); served at the IP from the boot banner (Ben/Claude).
- [x] Build interactive web app for the **4 W RGBW point source** (`firmware/rgbw_studio/`): R/G/B/W sliders, white/warmth presets + crossfade, hue/breathe/candle/fade animations, settings readback -- DONE, validated on hardware (ACM1, pin 10) (Ben/Claude).
- [x] Run the gobo session on the inverted-lantern rig -- **DONE 2026-06-11, VERDICT: BOTH module types, by role** (LOG 2026-06-12): HEX = animations/Split color-separation, best within ~6 ft (washes out at 10-15 ft); 4 W RGBW = crisp at 15 ft, Venn-diagram color fringing (overlaps mix NEW colors). Fleet = lanterns of both types. HEX looks best at 1-3 px (white or single-channel) -> realistic HEX gobo draw ~0.4-0.6 W battery-side = all-night budget (Ben).
- [x] **Record LED module = BOTH, by role** -- DONE 2026-06-17 via ADR 0022
  (`docs/decisions/0022-mixed-led-fleet-by-role.md`), preserving ADR 0018's IS31
  rejection and direct-GPIO constraint (Ben/Codex).
- [~] Decide HEX/RGBW **type mix and placement** -- **PRODUCTION ALLOCATION UPDATED
  2026-08-06** (ADR 0032 + SYSTEM.md fleet table): RGBW on 72 downlights in three
  rings of 24, HEX on all 24 perimeter hooks, mixed on 18 chandelier lights, and
  about 16 trunk lights trending all RGBW. The full nominal 130 is the target barring
  an unforeseen issue. Remaining LED decision: qualify the smaller lensed 3 W RGB
  trunk variant against 4 W RGBW (Ben + Steve + team).
- [ ] Rename or explicitly map the legacy firmware/manifest `uplight` class to the
  physical trunk-light role without creating a second fixture image (Ben/Codex).
- [ ] **Capture per-look settings**: when a look is a keeper, record the led_studio sliders + the UI Battery line voltage (brightness is SOC-dependent until the 4.2 V boost lands) (Ben + Steve).
- [ ] Compare Steve's **3 flat sample filters** through the rig; note which pattern reads best at the install throw (Ben).
- [ ] Capture ceiling photos per source/filter for the record; fold results into a gobo test write-up (Ben).
- [ ] If the swept-pixel / orbit moving-shadow looks good, decide whether it argues for a small multi-pixel array even in the "point source" role (Ben).
- [x] Re-test the **4 W RGBW** point source the same way -- DONE 2026-06-11 (led_studio dual-board session): point-vs-area settled as complementary, see verdict above (Ben).

## Noisemaker / audio bench

- [~] **Qualify the finalized solarnoid VDC + 22,000 uF daytime-solenoid power
  path:** the first 10,000 uF cap test passed qualitatively on 2026-07-14 and the
  22,000 uF follow-up bought headroom for stronger solenoids; ADR 0030 now fixes the
  production concept at VDC tap + 22,000 uF + solenoid + bulk mallet on large-hat
  downlights. The no-cap P126-panel kick was weak; a 10,000 uF/16 V electrolytic across
  V+/GND at the female-USB-C-to-XH breakout made it dramatically stronger. The leads
  align directly with the breakout holes, so installation was roughly one minute of
  soldering; prototype cost was about $1. Historical stack and design reasoning:
  `docs/research/AUTONOMOUS_DISTRIBUTED_CHOREOGRAPHY_CONCEPT_2026-07-13.md`.
  Remaining: commit and analyze the 22,000 uF/stronger-solenoid bench data; capture
  coil/pulse/VDC droop/recharge and physical-strike data; test sun/
  cloud/shade, P105/P126, charge/taper, hot-plug inrush, repeated strikes, BQ/reset/fault
  behavior, residual energy at dusk and possible bleeder, ESR/tolerance/temp/lifetime,
  strain relief, polarity/keying, and cold-Voc margin. P126 nominal Voc is about 8.59 V;
  measure worst-case cold Voc/tolerance to document margin for the 16 V part.
  Keep the 815-strike-proven 3V3/XH path as fallback (Ben).
- [~] **Finish root-causing and qualify the rev-1 3P boosted-capbank PowerFeather
  reset:** the corrected 2026-08-06 test used no USB and held
  4.914 V at the PowerFeather plus 12.17 V at the bank before the command, but a
  targeted 5 ms D7 pulse immediately restarted `F3FD7C` while visibly moving the
  HS-0730B. **BATTERY A/B STRONGLY NARROWS IT TO SOURCE-PATH TRANSIENT HEADROOM:**
  with the 3.33 V 32700 attached and A4/A5 unchanged, the same 5 ms pulse did not
  reset (uptime 182.3 -> 184.7 s; sequence 179 -> 181) and Ben judged the strike
  stronger. The loaded source already sat at its 4.66 V VINDPM floor. Scope the
  PowerFeather-facing VDC, local 3V3, GND, and D7 during the
  edge; A/B the shared 5 V source branch, control/telemetry harness, boost input
  decoupling, and isolation/ORing. Static checks (D7S 0 V, VSNS 3.00 V, D7 0 V)
  plus the successful battery run with A4/A5 attached make telemetry injection
  unlikely as the primary cause, but do not rule out ground bounce or switching
  noise. **BATTERY-INSTALLED BENCH ENVELOPE PASSED:** single 5-50 ms pulses,
  10x 20 ms at 15 s intervals, and radio-quiet 8/12/20/35/50 ms DMA captures all
  completed without reset/failsafe/overflow or warmth. D7S timing was within
  0.014 ms and robust 2 ms-median bank drop grew to about 1.77 V at 50 ms.
  **PAIRED DIRECT-5-V REFERENCE PASSED:** after discharging and removing the
  boost, the identical five-width sweep again completed cleanly. At 50 ms the
  direct bank fell 5.086 -> 4.800 V (5.63 percent; about 0.083 J net capacitor
  contribution), versus 12.284 -> 10.511 V boosted (14.44 percent; about
  1.193 J), a 14.3x boosted/direct bank-energy ratio. Keep this explicitly
  labeled net capacitor contribution, not total coil or mechanical energy,
  because VDC supplies current concurrently. Raw paired traces live under
  `ops/bench/data/ca/capbank/`.
  **2026-08-09 PHYSICAL RESULT:** the PowerFeather USER button produces a strong
  bounded 40 ms strike, proving the firmware-controlled D7/driver/cap-bank path.
  SW1 originally produced only a tiny strike with RECVR empty and none with the damaged
  receiver installed. Keep receivers out because the separate reversed-U1 fault
  above overvolts them. Firmware edge-detect plus bounded 40 ms takeover is now
  deployed for physical validation; scope SW1 D7 before deciding whether C1B or
  other component tuning is also useful.
  Remaining before production: scope PowerFeather VDC/3V3/GND/D7, test low-SOC
  and hot/solar cases, explicitly deduplicate strike event IDs, and isolate the
  separate USB+VDC/flash-failure mechanism. **HIGH-Z/SW1-TAKEOVER FIRMWARE CANDIDATE OTA-DEPLOYED
  2026-08-09, PARTIALLY VALIDATED:** an armed fixture now releases D7 to
  INPUT/high-Z at idle and after every MCU cutoff so rev-2 SW1 and optional
  RX480E D0 can drive the board's hardware one-shot through its own 10k pulldown;
  disarmed fixtures still clamp D7 LOW. The `Party In The Woods` targeted
  `fixture-2026-08-09.2` image is OTA-flashed on `9E5B8C`; firmware/sensor/bridge
  telemetry and the strong USER strike pass. SW1 requires a released LOW after
  boot, accepts one rising edge, and extends it to the independently bounded
  40 ms MCU pulse; boot-high/stuck-high cannot fire or retrigger. Next physically
  verify the SW1 extension, MCU/external collision
  refusal, timer/failsafe behavior, no reset,
  and return to high-Z. Do not close or choose this over a hardware diode OR until
  those checks pass. Quarantined
  flash-failed boards: `F402F4`, `F402B4`; surviving
  probe board: `F3FD7C` (Ben/Codex).
- [ ] **P0: root-cause PowerFeather V2 VUSB+VDC hot-plug/flash failures before
  deployed USB service is trusted:** two boards (`F402F4`, `F402B4`) developed
  invalid-header loops and invalid/unreadable JEDEC responses when the repeated
  condition of concern was VDC from one powered-hub branch plus native VUSB/data
  from the same hub. Neither had energized 12 V boost exposure. PowerFeather's
  official design explicitly Schottky-ORs VUSB and VDC and permits simultaneous
  use, so do not close this as a generic ground loop without transient evidence.
  Execute
  `docs/tests/POWERFEATHER_V2_DUAL_INPUT_USB_SERVICE_PLAN_2026-08.md`: preserve and
  compare the quarantined boards; probe VUSB/VDC/VS/internal `+3.3VP`/EN/reset and
  both input currents; reproduce first without capboard hardware under current
  limits; then add the Y harness, large bank, boost, telemetry, and strike one at a
  time. **Interim field rule:** use verified data-only/VBUS-blocked USB whenever
  VDC/panel is live; if USB must provide power, disconnect or shade VDC first. A
  switchable service adapter should default to DATA ONLY. Pass requires valid flash
  ID/hash and no rail/reset/thermal fault through >=50 actual hot-panel USB-service
  cycles. **2026-08-06 partial pass:** `F3FD7C` passed 5.0/5.8 V, both insertion
  orders, same-hub inputs, full Y/boost/charged-bank/D7/A4/A5 wiring, and 20/20
  consecutive native-USB reset/flash-ID cycles (`20:4017`, 8 MB) with no physical
  anomaly. Boost+capboard alone was only 0.17 W; the observed approximately 3 W
  was measured PowerFeather battery charging. Cambium has no fixture OTA uploader
  and the concurrent integration flashed only `F3FD88`, so an unlogged fleet OTA
  is not supported by current evidence. Still required: preserve/no-stub-test and
  dump both dead boards, scope rails/EN, use an actual panel, and complete 50
  physical service-cable cycles (Ben/Codex).
- [x] ~~Evaluate lantern noisemaker options on the Metro bench~~ -- **CLOSED
  2026-07-15 (ADR 0030)**: the shootout ended with the solenoid bamboo-strike;
  relay/speaker options are not pursued. `clacker_demo` stays as bench history (Ben).
- [x] **Candidate A: STEMMA speaker #3885 percussion synth -- ABANDONED 2026-07-15
  (ADR 0030): the solenoids strike the bamboo so well the speaker path is dropped.**
  The percussion synth + `speaker_demo` survive as bench/preview instruments only;
  the spare-#3885 buy is cancelled; the listen-test/loudness/RC-filter follow-ups
  below are moot for production. Original item preserved: BENCH APP LIVE 2026-07-07
  (`firmware/speaker_demo/` at `speakerdemo.local`, LOG same date): organic percussion
  (knock/marimba/chime/drip + ripple/grove scenes) instead of the square waves everyone
  hated. Bench unit's trim pot is broken (LOG item 6): solder-bridge the tweezer-found
  pad pair + order 1-2 spare #3885s before any crowd test. Remaining: controlled
  re-listen for residual whine on fw .8 (FIXED speaker mounting -- placement confounded
  tonight's spectra), Ben's listen test, crowd re-test, idle + playing current draw
  (amp quiescent on the 3V3 rail matters for the night budget), speaker-coupled-into-
  lantern acoustics (mounting coupling is first-order; the bamboo tube is a resonator),
  and volume ceiling outdoors. Amp-oscillator beats confirmed on this unit (LOG item 7):
  the PAM8302's free-running oscillator varies per chip, so for the fleet either add an
  inline RC low-pass (~1k + 10 nF) on SIG or evaluate the MAX98357A I2S amp (no pot,
  true DAC path, ~same price, 3 data wires); the dashboard carrier A/B button is the
  per-unit probe (Ben).
- [x] ~~Gather wider noisemaker opinions~~ -- **OVERTAKEN 2026-07-15 (ADR 0030)**:
  the solenoid's physical strikes settled the question on the bench (Ben).
- [~] **Candidate B -> THE noisemaker (DECIDED 2026-07-15, ADR 0030): MOSFET-driver
  + push-pull solenoid mallet** (physically striking
  the bamboo -- the authentic knock the synth imitates). **FIRST BENCH DONE
  2026-07-10** (`firmware/solenoid_demo/`, LOG same date): 815 strikes, no resets,
  no failsafes. **FLEET PARTS ORDERED**: 100x MOSFET drivers (Adafruit 07-10, $345;
  110 total with the 10 prior) + 150x solenoids (75x 3 V + 75x 5 V, AliExpress
  07-10, $319.12). Remaining: strike-power source decision (VDC-tap sweep tooling
  landed 07-11: Y-cable + storage cap vs battery/VS pin -- check strike transients
  don't confuse the BQ input), 3 V vs 5 V voltage A/B, driver control cabling
  (JST PH 3-pin), mallet/mounting design vs the O(1)-ops constraint (ADR 0009),
  and the formal candidate verdict vs the speaker synth. **P126 bright-sun trial
  staged 2026-07-13:** D7/GPIO37 targeted, timer-bounded manual strike firmware and
  dashboard control are USB-flashed and safety-verified on replacement peer `9F2690`;
  the original `9E5B0C` failed during header rework and was retired. **JULY 14 RESULT:**
  the no-cap panel strike was weak; adding 10,000 uF/16 V at the panel adapter produced
  a qualitatively excellent kick with an unexpectedly easy mechanical/solder fit. VDC +
  cap now leads; the candidate verdict itself is DECIDED (ADR 0030) and the
  **"solarnoid" design was finalized around July 24**, including craft-store bulk
  mallets (order TBC). Scope is settled: large-enclosure fixtures/downlights only, with
  surplus drivers expected. **BENCH STATUS 2026-07-16 (Ben-reported; data on the bench
  laptop, commit pending):** 22,000 uF buys headroom for stronger solenoids; the
  solenoid bake-off is mid-flight with the 0730B 6 V / 1 A as the primary candidate
  and the in-transit 3 V / 5 V units potentially returnable. **TRANSIENT QUESTION
  REOPENED 2026-08-06:** the external-boost rev-1 3P configuration power-cycled a
  PowerFeather on a 5 ms strike even with USB absent; the earlier direct-VDC/cap
  result remains valid for that topology but does not clear the boosted Y-cable
  variant. Remaining: boosted-path scope/isolation, bake-off verdict, possible stronger-solenoid
  order/return, driver control cabling, mounting, and daytime gating.
  **JULY 16 LOCAL CONTROL:** corrected
  `net-bench-2026-07-16.2` is OTA-deployed to `9F2690`; one debounced PowerFeather
  USER/GPIO0 press now wakes the peer if needed and requests the same fail-safe 40 ms
  D7 strike, with physical-release re-arm and maintenance suppression. The first `.1`
  implementation woke once but its RTC-retained re-arm state could remain disarmed after
  re-sleep; `.2` removes that state, treats EXT0 wake itself as the one-shot event, and
  re-enables EXT0 before every sleep only when GPIO0 is actually HIGH. Physical repeat
  validation remains: sleep -> press/strike -> re-sleep -> press/strike, plus no held-
  button loop, normal ESP-NOW rejoin, and no BQ/reset fault. The DFR0991 illuminated I2C
  button is an optional awake-mode trigger; its separate active-HIGH INT pin could wake
  an RTC GPIO only if the module remains powered, while current field sleep cuts both
  external 3V3 rails. (Ben/Codex).
- [ ] **Commit the solenoid bake-off experiments from the bench laptop** -- the
  post-07-11 work (22k uF headroom sweeps, stronger-solenoid bake-off) is not in
  the repo; only solenoid_demo/led_sol_bench + the 07-11 VDC sweep are (Ben).
- [ ] **Decide the 3 V/5 V solenoid return** (150 units, $319.12, still in
  transit) once the 0730B verdict lands -- watch the AliExpress return window
  (Ben).

## Presence sensing / interactivity bench (research note: docs/research/PRESENCE_SENSING_INTERACTIVITY_2026-06-12.md) -- Elliot ask, 2026-06-12

- [x] **Stand up the 4-sensor comparison bench -- DONE 2026-07-02** (LOG same date):
  `firmware/presence_bench/` on the repurposed spare PowerFeather V2, wireless
  dashboard at `presencebench.local` (live thermal heatmap, tap-a-zone multizone ToF
  grids, radar depth strip, browser-side baseline/delta/occlusion-mask/PRESENT
  tiles), `ops/bench/presence_logger.py` JSONL logging with Enter-key ground-truth
  marks. Sensors: MLX90640 (0x33), VL53L5CX 8x8 w/ vendored 2-target driver (0x29),
  TMF8821 (0x41), XM125 (0x52, ships with the Acconeer DISTANCE app). Multi-target
  per zone VERIFIED on hardware (10 desk zones with near+far pairs). Supersedes the
  original "$10 kit" plan for the imaging axis; LD2420 mmWave + IMU remain open
  below (Ben/Claude).
- [ ] **Dashboard eyeball pass + first walk-under session** (Ben): capture a
  baseline, walk under the rig, check the four PRESENT tiles + event-log ordering;
  log a run with presence_logger.py.
- [ ] **Rig session on the actual lantern** (Ben + Steve): hang under the solar
  overhang pointing down, capture baseline -> occlusion hatching over the bamboo
  splay, record **"usable zones X/64 (VL53), Y/9 (TMF)"** -- the self-occlusion
  deliverable -- and check whether occluded zones still range the floor via T1.
- [x] Add the TOF400C/VL53L1X (the ~$3 original primary candidate) as a 5th bench
  sensor -- **DONE 2026-07-02** (`.13` + TCA9548A mux): both 0x29 ToFs behind
  their own mux ports, all five sensors verified streaming (L1X 1612 mm status-0,
  agreeing with the VL53's far targets). Software VL53L5CX address relocation was
  ABANDONED after a reproducible zombie-until-power-cycle (known ST issue; LOG
  cont. 2); the mux is the architecture. XSHUT jumper on A0 retained as the
  no-mux fallback gate (Ben/Claude).
- [ ] Investigate XM125 distance-app decode against the Acconeer A121 register
  spec: peak strengths return a 0xEEEEEE00 sentinel, and peaks 2+ read beyond the
  configured 0.2-5 m window (10.4 m / 31.6 m) -- treat as one bug. Also consider
  reflashing the module with the PRESENCE app (motion-tuned intra/inter scores;
  the distance app reports all static reflectors, which made desk testing
  uncorrelatable with motion) (Ben/Claude).
- [x] **Presence-bench battery-only reboots -- SOLVED 2026-07-03 (LOG 07-02
  cont. 5-10 + 07-03): root cause was OUR 400 kHz Wire1 clock on the shared
  power-management bus** (the "measured exception" to POWERFEATHER_NOTES).
  Controlled A/B: identical firmware at 400 kHz died in seconds on battery; at
  100 kHz the full 5-sensor bench runs indefinitely (7.3 h + 900 s formal
  soaks). Mechanism: corrupted charger (BQ25628E) transactions under WiFi TX
  open the power path (BATFET/HIZ class) -> instant poweron reset; USB immune.
  100 kHz now the compiled default; rules added to POWERFEATHER_NOTES. The
  elimination ladder also formally exonerated: sensors, A0 jumper, 26650
  holder, both cells, both boards, SoftAP beaconing, the TPS631013 crossover
  band (stable at 3.33 V under heavy TX), NVS writes, charge-enable (Ben/Claude).
- [ ] Reboot-hunt residuals: reflash led_studio onto the desk board (r10 still
  queued); sharpie-label both boards (spare = ex-9F2690 master, desk =
  led_studio home); OPTIONAL Test B (400 kHz round-robin from core 1) if the
  core-aggravator question ever matters; custom-PCBA design rule captured in
  POWERFEATHER_NOTES: dedicated I2C bus for charger/gauge (Ben/Claude).
- [ ] **Fleet hygiene: chemistry profile must match the attached cell.** The old
  net_bench master image (Li-ion profile) was found actively overcharging the
  4 Ah LFP toward 4.2 V on USB (real terminal reading 4.19 V; relaxed to plateau
  once charging was disabled). Audit any board that gets a cell: image `--chem`
  vs physical chemistry (Ben).
- [ ] Confirm which cell is attached to the presence-bench PowerFeather; its gauge
  telemetry is inconsistent (bv 4.12 vs 3.68, ma -290 vs 0) and this sketch
  deliberately leaves charging OFF (Ben).
- [x] ~~Order the remaining kit (LD2420/LD2410 mmWave, LD2450, LIS3DH/MPU6050 IMU)~~
  -- **SUPERSEDED 2026-07-08 by the production sensor buy (ADR 0027)**: MSA311 +
  TMF8820-mini + VL53L5CX ordered at fleet scale on 2026-07-07; mmWave dropped
  (continuous-power appetite); fused/other IMUs rejected (per-device cal). LD2450
  remains a possible future choreography experiment, not a fleet part (Ben).
- [ ] **Finish per-class sensor validation** (ADR 0027 + ADR 0034): TMF8820-mini
  downward on all downlights, VL53L5CX outward on perimeter, and BMP581 on the
  complete 24-light outer hanging ring with 6 spares. The first five outer-ring
  downlights passed live MSA311/TMF8820/BMP581 production-firmware sampling on
  2026-08-08. Remaining: physically count the received BMP581 inventory and run
  one downlight-height test on the exact ordered TMF8820-mini part (earlier height
  work used the TMF8821) (Ben).
- [x] ~~Bring up the BMP581 on the STEMMA chain and add temp/pressure to
  maintenance telemetry~~ -- **DONE 2026-07-29 on enclosed `F2BFA0`:** BMP581,
  MSA311, and exact ordered TMF8820-mini all initialized and returned live data
  on the shared 100 kHz bus after targeted OTA. The opt-in diagnostic samples
  every two seconds; it is not yet production energy/timing qualified (Ben/Codex).
- [x] ~~Make a sensor-reactive RGBW proof of concept~~ -- **DONE 2026-07-29 on
  enclosed `F2BFA0`:** LED Studio now offers ToF-depth, relative-tilt, and
  pressure-derived relative-elevation modes plus live sensor readout and manual
  re-zero controls. The TMF filter ignored the repeatable 20-21 mm enclosure
  return and reacted to a usable target around 219 mm (Ben/Codex).
- [ ] Field-tune the LED Studio mappings: ToF near/far endpoints (currently
  120/1200 mm), tilt full-scale (35 deg), and elevation span (+-1.5 m) (Ben).
- [x] ~~Remove LED Studio sensor stalls and expose WiFi health~~ -- **DONE
  2026-07-29 on `F2BFA0`:** replaced the blocking TMF convenience call with a
  cooperative start/process/stop state machine on the main 100 kHz loop, prevented
  overlapping browser polls, and added RSSI/request-latency/TMF-age diagnostics.
  State requests fell from 0.7-1.8 s to 112 ms mean / 204 ms p95; button commands
  averaged 35 ms; 776 TMF frames ran with zero errors/recoveries (Ben/Codex).
- [ ] Guard LED Studio charge enable on confirmed battery presence, matching the
  safer net_bench/sway pattern, before using a sensor-triad build on a bare board
  with external VDC but no cell (Ben/Codex).
- [ ] Add the winning sensor(s) to the net_bench heartbeat (append-only tail, same
  pattern as env/INA) and dashboard for yard/field tuning. Current triad readings
  are available only through maintenance `/telemetry`; interpret/calibrate the
  TMF8820's high-confidence 20 mm near return against the enclosure/window before
  treating it as presence (Claude + whoever's bench).
- [ ] **ToF eye test**: downward VL53L1X at 2.5-3.5 m hang height -- detection vs
  false-positive rate with person under/standing/leaving vs sway (fan/manual swing);
  ground-baseline temporal filter; dirty-cover-glass crosstalk calibration check (Steve-runnable).
- [ ] **Radar test**: LD2420 duty-cycled power draw (continuous ~80 mA = LED-show-class,
  unacceptable); through-enclosure detection from inside a mock hat/lantern body; self-sway
  false positives +- IMU veto; 2-unit mutual-interference check (Steve-runnable).
- [ ] **Mesh-RSSI presence experiment (FREE)**: 3-5 net_bench nodes in the yard, someone
  walks figure-eights -- do per-link RSSI step-changes localize people? Existing JSONL
  tooling; zero new hardware (Ben or Steve).
- [ ] **Enclosure**: downward eye port placement vs the gobo aperture (they share the
  lantern bottom) -- small recessed window beside the gobo margin? (Steve).
- [ ] Sketch the PRESENCE event packet + a first ripple choreography (master-relayed or
  peer-flooded with hop-count) -- the mesh choreography IS the product; sensor is the seed
  (Ben + Claude).
- [ ] Report findings to Elliot (interactivity = his ask; BOM impact ~$3-6/lantern) (Ben).

## HEX 4.2 V boost bench test -- TPS63802 (STEVE-RUNNABLE while Ben travels, 2026-06-12)

Context (LOG 2026-06-12 cont.): at our sagged ~2.8-2.95 V LED rail the SK6812's blue/green
channels run in dropout (starved -> the "goldening"); a regulated 4.2 V V+ should recover
**~40-60 % more white lumens**, fix color balance, and make looks **SOC-invariant**
(same sliders = same light on every lantern at any charge). 4.2 V (NOT 5 V!) keeps the
WS-data threshold in spec for 3.3 V GPIO (VIH = 0.7 x VDD = 2.94 V; at 5 V it's 3.5 = broken).
Steve has duplicate components; firmware/tools all in-repo (led_studio has battery stats +
OTA; afk/PAR harness in ops/bench; site code for Steve's data = `tn`).

- [x] Source a **TPS63802 buck-boost module** -- DONE 2026-07-02: Ben bulk-bought
  Amazon modules pre-jumpered to 4.2 V (Ben).
- [ ] Re-jumper output 3V3 -> 4V2: fully OPEN the 3V3 bridge first (both bridged = wrong
  feedback divider), close 4V2, **meter the output UNLOADED before any pixel sees it**.
  Leave the tiny EN pad untouched (tied to VIN; kill-switch = the GPIO4 3V3 rail). Leave
  the PS pad at default (power-save/PFM = light-load efficiency; flip ONLY if dim
  single-pixel flicker appears) (Steve).
- [ ] Wire: PowerFeather switchable 3V3 header -> module IN; module OUT 4.2 V -> HEX V+;
  common GND; HEX data direct to GPIO10 as usual. led_studio drives it unchanged (Steve).
- [x] **Measure (the decision data): lumens-per-system-watt rail-direct vs boosted
  4.2 V** -- **MEASURED 2026-07-02, decision recorded in ADR 0029 (HEX stays on the
  3V3 rail; boost NOT worth it for the HEX gobo regime).** VEML7700 photopic harness + boost_ab_log.py/
  boost_ab_suite.sh, 4-swap A/B/A/B series, seating error bounded <=2 %. Single white
  px full: +1.6 % light for +60 % LED-branch power (lumens/W ~40 % WORSE); blue single
  +5.1 %, ring1 7 px bri128 +6.9 % -- gain grows with load per dropout physics, but
  Ben's product call is that >1 full-white px washes out the gobo, so the heavy-load
  regime is moot for HEX. The +40-60 % white expectation REFUTED at plateau voltage
  (it assumed the 2.8-2.95 V heavy-load sag, which the single-px look never causes).
  REMAINING (demoted 2026-07-02 after topology correction: hex V+ is the regulated
  3V3 rail, so bare is SOC-invariant by construction until deep discharge): low-SOC
  spot-check = watch for rail droop under load at low VIN only, 10 min on a drained
  cell, unlikely to flip; 4 W RGBW point source is a separate question (Ben/Steve).
- [x] **Redo the boost A/B for the 4 W RGBW point source** -- **CAMPAIGN COMPLETE
  2026-07-02, matrix recorded in ADR 0029 (boost shelved with complete numbers;
  the rail-vs-VBAT production feed decision is OPEN there). r10 residual + the
  feed-decision item carved out below.** Detail: rail-fed variant
  MEASURED 2026-07-02 (gold standard r6, LOG same date): boost = 2.2x clean white
  (1044 vs 470 lux W-full) at ~37 % efficacy tax; rgbwhite rail-walls at bri=128
  (3x replicated); bare rgbwhite-full ~1310 lux is the free bright option and Ben's
  production GO.** **VBAT-fed variant MEASURED 2026-07-02 (r7, LOG same date):
  ~11 % battery-side saving vs two-stage (tax ~37 % -> ~28 % aim-corrected), ESP
  decoupling PROVEN (board draw constant 116-118 mA through a branch collapse), and
  the rgbwhite wall becomes a harness-wiring limit (~0.3 ohm loop) instead of the
  rail regulator.** BOTH variants now characterized; boost stays SHELVED (bare is
  the GO). **MATRIX COMPLETED 2026-07-02 (r8/r9, LOG same date): VBAT-direct + fat
  wire is the production topology with or without boost -- bare-VBAT rgbwhite 1746
  lux (+33 % over rail-fed, no wall), boosted-VBAT-fat 3044 lux rgbwhite / 1016 W-only,
  no wall anywhere on proper wiring; the walls were the rail regulator and harness R,
  never the architecture. LED power must tap DOWNSTREAM of the gauge shunt (header
  tap is coulomb-invisible).** If boost is ever revived: VBAT-fed single conversion
  on the adapter PCB, EN->GPIO + pull-down for software kill (bench module EN is tied
  to VIN = always-live V+; SK6812 latches -- blank before unplugging), and
  connector/trace quality specced (worth ~25 % of top-end light).
  (r10 detail moved to its own item below.) Also note for any "boost for top-end only" revival: the
  efficacy tax is per-lumen and duty-independent (dies at 4.2 V whenever lit), so
  selective-boost needs a bypass path around the TPS63802 (EN-low disconnects the
  output entirely) -- a real adapter-PCB circuit decision (Ben).
  Original design note below stands: the
  PowerFeather 3V3 header is ~1 A-limited (per Ben), so full-power RGBW white is
  supply-limited in BOTH configs off that rail: rail-direct 4 W white already wants
  ~1.2 A at 3.3 V, and a boost fed from the header tops out around 3 W in minus
  conversion loss. Step 0 is characterizing what the rail actually delivers (the HEX
  A/B peaked at 0.21 A; the 2026-06-10 discharge gives one heavier anchor: ~2.97 V at
  the LED at ~290 mA -- LOG 2026-07-02. Also probe Ben's recalled radio-burst-during-
  LED-hogging brownout: rail voltage during WiFi/radio bursts at high LED load). The honest
  full-power comparison is likely rail-direct vs **boost-fed-from-VBAT** (the
  adapter-PCB production topology), battery INA as truth source. W channel is real on
  this module (unlike the RGB-only NeoHEX) -- include W-only and W-vs-RGB-white looks.
  Harness/tooling reuse as-is: boost_ab_log.py + a boost_ab_suite variant with
  RGBW-appropriate looks (Ben).
- [ ] **r10: battery-plane watts for the two uninstrumented configs** -- bare-VBAT-fat
  and boosted-VBAT-fat (the 3044 lux point has NO measured power; current estimate
  ~3.0-4.5 W, ~700-1000 lux/W, estimate-on-estimate). Method that avoids re-poisoning
  the loop: SEN0291 IN+/IN- are SCREW TERMINALS -- clamp the fat wire directly, no
  duponts; shunt adds only 10 mOhm. One ladder per config, update the report's fig 4.
  Requires reflashing led_studio onto the desk board first (Ben).
- [ ] **Firmware count-cap for boosted builds** -- **moot unless the boost is revived
  (ADR 0029 shelved it)**: all-37 full white at a regulated 4.2 V wants ~2 A out
  (~8 W in) = instant brownout -- cap n (or estimated total current) in led_studio
  when V+ is boosted (Steve or Ben).
- [x] ~~Spec the production boost variant on the NeoHEX adapter PCB rev~~ -- **CLOSED
  2026-07-08 as SKIP per ADR 0029** (no boost for either role). The revival spec
  (VBAT-fed single conversion, EN->GPIO + pull-down, fat wiring) is preserved in
  ADR 0029 if a future look needs the ceiling (Ben).
- [ ] **DECIDE the RGBW production feed: 3V3 rail (as wired today) vs VBAT-direct
  (+33 % fringed white, free)** -- before the harness buy, since it forks connector
  set and firmware pinout (ADR 0029 has the full trade). Ben's sketched conversion:
  solder a 4-pin header along {VBAT | EN | VS | D13} pulling VBAT -> V+ and
  D13 -> signal, GND via a cheap JST 2-pin Y-cable (~$0.50) off the GND pin next to
  VDC/solar+ -- needs ~100 Y-cables sourced at quantity, firmware A0 -> D13, and a
  fail-safe redesign (no 3V3-rail shutoff means a stuck-on frame can kill the
  battery -- verify all-off + a default-off switch element per ADR 0013). Reasons
  to stay on the rail: clean W-only is unchanged, the rail cut is a robust hard
  kill, and the rail hookup is easy/robust. Side benefit of converting: frees
  3V3/GND/A0 for a clacker/relay payload (Ben).

## Networking feasibility -- 5x PowerFeather V2 (net_bench, 2026-06-07; de-risked the buy -- fleet now nominally 130, ADR 0032)

See `docs/tests/NETWORKING_FEASIBILITY_5NODE_2026-06-07.md` + `firmware/net_bench/`.

- [x] Build the first ESP-NOW firmware + 5-node host harness (broadcast comms, master/peer roles, maintenance-mode WiFi OTA, watchdog, per-source PDR, scale-extrapolation summarizer). Bench-validated on 1 board (Ben/Claude).
- [~] **Flash all 5 boards with `--channel <AP channel>`** (home AP "BubbyNet" = ch 11) and run T0-T7 -- channel MUST match the AP or ESP-NOW silently fails. Partial 2026-06-07/08: master + 3-4 peers ran the matrix (one board never booted); full 5-board pass still open (Ben).
- [x] Run the **rate sweep** (1/2/5/10/20/50 Hz) -- **PASS 2026-06-07** (LOG): >=97 % PDR to 250 pkt/s aggregate, clean knee; ~100-node projection at 1-2 Hz = 98-99 % PDR (Ben).
- [x] **Range** T3 -- **PASS 2026-06-08**: link held through house + yard + oak (~100 steps); solar panel is the main ~20 dB attenuator; obstruction mapping captured (Ben).
- [ ] **Re-run the scale extrapolation at 130 deployed nodes** (it was computed at
  100); optionally include 150 as a conservative inventory-backed stress case, and
  restate the projected PDR honestly (Ben/Claude).
- [x] **Cambium three-fixture acceptance** -- DONE 2026-08-06 on the three Nevada
  City perimeter units: CoreS3 COBS bridge status, 3/3 heartbeat census, roll-call,
  direct program 3 on all nodes, and >3 s silence fallback to autonomous program 1;
  67/67 bridge sends, zero TX failures/CRC errors/RX drops. The old LED Studio
  artifacts and channel 6 were restored afterward, but channel 6 was not a
  presence-bench requirement: it came from one fixture build that omitted the
  channel-11 flag plus the explicit `H6` restore. Follow-up `.5` fixture firmware
  now migrates that known legacy state to the production channel 11; all three
  perimeter units reported channel 11 on hardware (Ben/Codex).
- [x] **CoreS3 audio-reactive three-perimeter demo** -- DONE 2026-08-06 after
  moving Module Audio's physical I2S selector to B (CoreS3): Rode input reached
  RMS 3,423 / 98.7% envelope; F3FD88/F2BE80/F2BFEC all entered direct program 3
  and matched every addressed frame. Stopping the bridge returned all three to
  autonomous program 1 after the three-second stale-frame limit. All fixtures
  acknowledged `N2`, remained on channel 11, and the bridge was left audio-off
  (Ben/Codex).
- [ ] **Bring up the received PUCA performance-audio bridge (ADR 0035):** verify
  Original Edition identity, Eurorack ribbon orientation, both knobs, paw, exact
  RODE audio-input route, codec gain, and unclipped levels; then create
  `firmware/puca_bridge/` by reusing the CoreS3 platform-independent audio logic
  and canonical packet definitions. First milestone is existing 10 Hz
  `NB_DIRECT_FRAME` on channel 11 with the three-second fixture stale fallback,
  not raw-audio transport or a new feature-packet protocol. Finish with mixed
  HEX/RGBW, closed-Pod20 RF/PDR, overrun, reset, and multi-hour stability tests.
  Full checklist: `hardware/puca-audio-bridge/README.md` (Ben/Codex).
- [x] Merge/review `codex/cambium-direct-frames` -- DONE 2026-08-06: rebased
  over the 2 A policy, native/build/hardware-smoke verified, and fast-forwarded
  to `beneckart/resonance-lighting` `origin/main` at `d9333ab` (Ben/Codex).
- [x] Publish the companion Cambium integration -- DONE 2026-08-06: forked
  `justinlange/cambium`, published `codex/fleet-130-bench3`, and
  fast-forwarded `beneckart/cambium` `main` to `b071542` (340 passed / 1
  skipped). License remains pending Justin (Ben/Codex).
- [ ] Repeat direct streaming on a mixed HEX/RGBW fleet before production
  rollout (Ben/Codex).
- [ ] **Parallel OTA cycle** on 5 nodes via `net_bench_ota.py` -- confirm 5/5 auto-recover with NO physical button (the field-reset requirement) (Ben).
- [ ] **Rehearse shared-WiFi OTA at tree scale (about 100 awake peers) on the actual
  portable router:** measure maintenance discovery/DHCP success, safe upload
  concurrency, aggregate completion time, reboot/rejoin verification, and retry
  rate. Current approximately 1.02 MB images imply about 2 minutes of pure transfer
  at five jobs, but operational planning should reserve 20-30 minutes until router
  client capacity and the full workflow are measured (Ben/Codex).
- [ ] **Multi-hour battery stability** soak (Li-ion) -- zero unexplained resets, log mAh/h drain (Ben).
- [ ] **Master WiFi+ESP-NOW coexistence** current/stability run (Ben).
- [ ] **RE-VERIFY all battery/stability findings on LFP** once Steve's cell holders/connectors exist -- Li-ion is necessary-not-sufficient (LFP plateau = buck-boost crossover) (Ben).
- [ ] 20+ node confirmation run if the rate knee lands near the production point (Ben).
- [ ] Mock-hat antenna RF with panel/battery installed (Steve; COTS Phase 7).
- [ ] **Lengthen the identify/locate blink** -- 8 s is too short for human-in-the-loop / field use (missed a single blink due to chat latency; live sweeps work but one-at-a-time doesn't). Make it ~30 s, or toggle-until-stop, and add identify-by-specific-ID (Ben).
- [x] **Make battery capacity runtime-settable (NVS), not a build flag** -- DONE 2026-06-28 in `net_bench`: master serial `C<mah>` stores capacity in peer NVS and reboots to apply the gauge model; `G<mA>` stores/applies the charge-current cap live. Build flags remain defaults, not per-board destiny.
- [ ] **Validate fuel-gauge SOC over a real charge/discharge cycle** + confirm the field (sleep + low-load solar charge) anchors the gauge cleanly, unlike the always-pinging bench (the false-low was likely a bench artifact). Production low-battery logic must cross-check voltage (done for the LED) (Ben).
- [x] Promote results into **ADR 0021** -- DONE 2026-06-08: `docs/decisions/0021-powerfeather-v2-feasibility-validated.md` (go; networking + solar + field-OTA validated, open follow-ups listed) (Ben).

## Fixture auto-localization (RSSI + ToF -> CAD registration; sim study 2026-07-12)

See `docs/tests/AUTOLOCATE_RSSI_SIM_FEASIBILITY_2026-07-12.md` + `ops/locate/`.

- [ ] **Small-N real pairwise capture (the calibration gate)**: 10-20 boards in the
  backyard, full pairwise RSSI for ~1 min, solve with `locate_run.py --pairwise`.
  Measures the real sigma_link (playa-band estimate is 2-6 dB, unverified) -- the
  sim verdict is conditional on this number (Ben).
- [ ] **Firmware pairwise neighbor-RSSI dump** emitting the `ops/locate` JSONL
  contract: every device reports per-neighbor median RSSI per window, WITH expected
  packet counts and the on-device censoring-corrected median (reference:
  `locate/rssi.py:_directional_median`; the neighbor table in firmware/ARCHITECTURE.md
  already holds per-neighbor RSSI; bridge collects) (Ben/Claude).
- [ ] **Perimeter ring: 24 lights at R ~6.5 m (DIRECTION, Ben 2026-07-27)** --
  redundancy waived (bridge health visits every few days + swap flow); geometry:
  N >= 2*pi*(R+x)/(0.83x) for VL53L5CX 45-deg FoV -> N=24 closes blind spots at
  exactly x=3 m (the reliable night range) when R <= 6.5 m; spacing 1.70 m;
  closure distance scales as 0.46*R if the ring moves. ZERO-margin geometry:
  a ~10-deg yawed hook opens a seam -- do an aim-audit pass at install (the
  8x8 ground-plane fit doubles as an automatic aim check via the bridge).
  Bonuses: ring sits outside canopy shade (P126 panels in clean sky); wider
  ring = longer rotation-gauge lever arm for localization (96 vs 112 anchors,
  minor cost per the anchors sweep). Re-run the ops/locate sim with
  perimeter_n=24, radius 6.5 m when the layout firms up (Ben/Claude).
- [ ] **GPS soft anchors (4x SAM-M8Q)**: bought for dusk/dawn time; also usable as
  hands-free gauge anchors -- not slot-level (2-2.5 m CEP vs 0.7-1 m spacing) but
  4 units spread wide give mirror + rotation to ~8-10 deg (= the 3-hand-beacon
  coarse gauge, inside the solver's +-20 deg refinement) + true-north/geo-reference
  of the as-built tree (measures real door-axis azimuth vs sun arc) + mesh time.
  Needs: soft 3D position priors in ops/locate refine (sibling of z-anchors,
  sigma ~2 m) + a sim arm vs the 0/3-beacon baselines; antenna needs sky view
  (NOT under the panel); SBAS on, hours-long static average; ADR 0028 bus rules
  (Ben/Claude).
- [ ] **Replacement/swap flow** (validated in sim 2026-07-15, report addendum: 6/6
  correct even at 8 dB): unconfigured node beacons "whoami" -> bridge roll-call
  diffs live MACs vs fleet map -> ~1 min neighbor RSSI capture -> pinned solve
  (existing pipeline, survivors = known) -> write fixture_id/xyz/neighbor-table NVS
  OTA. Firmware needs: unconfigured-beacon state, NVS config schema + epoch, bridge
  assign command. Same machinery doubles as a drift watchdog (node compares live
  neighbor RSSI vs stored expectations, self-reports if moved/fallen) (Ben/Claude).
- [~] **Design the light placement layout** -- Nevada City production layout
  converged 2026-08-06 (ADR 0032): 72 downlights in three rings of 24, 24 all-HEX
  perimeter, 18 mixed chandelier, and about 16 trunk lights trending RGBW. Per
  Elliot (2026-07-15, via Ben),
  the build-dashboard STRUCTURAL geometry is correct (6.5 m tree, 10 m canopy,
  24 limbs, 2.7 m waist) but its lighting sketch (~90 lights) is NOT the plan.
  Remaining design inputs to
  reconcile in one layout: (1) gobo non-overlap -- at 7 ft hang with the LED
  dropped 6", ground-pattern diameter ~0.84 m, so downlight spacing >= ~0.85 m
  (the 10 m canopy makes this feasible; the 0.3.1 CAD's inner ring at ~0.5 m
  spacing does not); (2) inner ring moves outward anyway (bamboo criss-cross
  above it shades the panels; better hang points at the bamboo split
  criss-crosses, per Ben + Steve); (3) mild rotational ASYMMETRY in the perimeter
  ring helps the auto-localization registration gauge (even spacing is the worst
  case, see AUTOLOCATE report); (4) hang points must exist on the real limbs --
  get the structural export/hang-point map from Elliot. Output: our own
  fixtures.json (schema resonance.fixtures/0.x) that replaces the 0.3.1 patch as
  ops/locate ground truth and feeds the Lighting-Controller app (Ben + Steve +
  Claude).
- [ ] **Plan THREE surveyed "beacon" fixtures into installation** -- record which
  fixture slot 3 distinctive devices occupy (hand note or bridge identify-blink).
  This pins the registration gauge; without it the rotational alignment rests on a
  ~1-2 % cost margin, and 2 beacons cannot pin the mirror (measured + regression-
  tested, see report) (Ben).
- [ ] Confirm perimeter VL53L5CX **mount downtilt** with Steve: at 5 ft with ~4 m
  range, ground zones need ~15 deg downtilt for the plane-fit height anchor the
  study assumes (Steve).
- [ ] **Write an ADR after Ben reviews the verdict**: fixture auto-location =
  RSSI+ToF (+beacons) / photogrammetry / manual -- decision + consequences. (Ben).

## Field reliability concerns (surfaced 2026-06-04 -- important for the deployed lantern)

- [ ] **Auto/remote reset is unreliable on the bench USB-JTAG path -- harden the FIELD reset paths so a deployed lantern NEVER needs a physical button press** (that would mean taking it down + disassembling = unacceptable). Observed: after a USB flash, the PowerFeather's "Hard reset via RTS pin" sometimes did NOT start the app (no liveness LED) until a *physical* reset or a serial-open nudge (chip verified healthy via esptool; worst on the heavily-abused board 2). Field paths: (1) **OTA `/update` software reset (`esp_restart`)** -- **VALIDATED 2026-06-08: ~17/17 battery-only OTAs recovered, no button, incl. 3/3 on LFP at the ~3.2 V buck-boost crossover; new image confirmed running, `rr=software` every time.** The JTAG-RTS flakiness is USB-flash-only, not OTA; (2) **watchdog** -- DONE + validated in `net_bench` (port to production); (3) `--autosleep` USB-supply recovery -- validated. **Remaining OTA-robustness (refinements, not blockers -- a failed OTA is safe: stays on / A-B rolls back, never bricks):** (a) OTA over a **marginal/lossy WiFi link** (field maintenance assumes a decent local AP). (b) **A/B rollback -- VALIDATED 2026-06-08:** a self-test-failing image (`extern "C" verifyOta()`->false) auto-reverts to the last-good image, no touch, battery-only. Gotcha: the hook is C-linkage (needs `extern "C"`, else it silently doesn't override and the bad image sticks). Goal met for the happy path: zero field scenarios needing the reset button (Ben).
- [ ] **Implement the production rollback/health pattern in the real firmware**: `extern "C" bool verifyOta()` self-test (power chip + radio + fuel-gauge reachable); PLUS `verifyRollbackLater()=true` to defer the mark-valid + extended self-test + watchdog so an image that PASSES verifyOta but crashes/hangs LATER still rolls back (otherwise it's marked valid and could brick). power_bench has the gated `RES_OTA_FAIL_SELFTEST` test fixture to verify it (Ben).
- [ ] **Derive the nightly power budget bottom-up from measured draw** -- the old ~120 mAh/night napkin floor is RETIRED (2026-07-02): it assumed ~5 mA time-avg LEDs, pre-hardware, and crisp-gobo light levels invalidate it; do not anchor on it. Real budget = brightness x LED count x duty cycle from measured HEX/RGBW draw (400-500 mA at full) + a realistic show duty cycle; then size battery (LFP capacity) + panel (W) to it.
  **Runtime math notes (2026-07-22, Ben + Claude, vs the solarsim harvest numbers):**
  measured full-RGBW draw 1.364 W battery-side (ADR 0026 INA chain); single-channel
  warm white ~0.34 W (1/4 of full). Reference show profile: 5 h bright at 50% duty
  (3.4 Wh) + 4 h dim single-channel at 50% (0.7 Wh) = ~4.1 Wh/night, spanning the
  ~10 h dark window. Two opposing corrections when reading ops/solarsim figures:
  plotted runtimes omit the ~0.85 LFP discharge round-trip (the x0.63 chain is
  charge-side only), but the python sim runs ~0.70x of the SketchUp reference --
  net usable ~1.21x plotted, i.e. plan against plotted Wh as usable and carry ~20%
  implicit margin. Fleet check (hinged canopy): worst lantern 4.6 Wh plotted
  (~5.6 usable) covers the reference show; median 9.2 Wh = ~2x headroom; the
  one-rule uniform-30 hinge floor (3.1 Wh) does NOT cover it in the north arc --
  the two-rule hinge is what buys the whole fleet the baseline show. Caveats:
  0.70 is model-vs-model median (per-light scatter, rank corr 0.87) -- bank the
  floor only after Elliot's re-raytrace or real panel telemetry. The COTS tests show PowerFeather has the headroom; this just sets the cell/panel spec (Ben).
- [~] **Buck-boost converter efficiency varies with VBAT -- and LFP's plateau sits on the crossover (real budget + chemistry finding).** **PARTIAL ANSWER 2026-06-10** (`ops/bench/bb_efficiency.py` on the full-discharge JSONL -- no new bench time): at full-RGBW show load the LFP *terminal* voltage sags to ~2.9-3.05 V, so the converter ran in **boost the entire pre-brownout discharge -- the 3.25-3.35 V crossover band was never visited under load**. Overhead (ESP+WiFi+converter, not separable) ~0.48-0.52 W and roughly flat; P_led/P_batt lower bound 0.61-0.64. So the crossover-tax concern does NOT apply at show loads; **the residual open regime is the production light/ambient load (tens of mA), where the plateau terminal V ~3.2-3.3 V DOES sit near the crossover** -- needs a light-load fixed-brightness discharge (or rail-side metering for absolute eta). Caveats: n=1 cell/board/load; apparent fine structure vs VBAT may be time-confounded (WiFi activity). `battery_mA` != LED current (TPS631013 buck-boost sits between them); efficiency dips in the buck<->boost crossover (~VBAT 3.25-3.35 V) where it 4-switch/mode-hunts. **LFP's flat plateau (~3.2-3.3 V) parks right there for most of the discharge** = a standing efficiency tax on everything; **Li-ion lives mostly in clean buck** (better converter efficiency, the counterpoint to LFP's safety/heat/cycle wins). **Test:** hold one fixed brightness, discharge full->empty, log `ima` vs `VBAT` -> maps converter efficiency vs SOC (the real budget input) + confirms the crossover bump; run on LFP and Li-ion to quantify the chemistry tax. NOTE this **confounds the existing PAR/mA efficiency plots** (each LED run was at a different SOC/load -> different converter point), so those slopes are *system* efficiency at as-measured conditions, not a clean LED-intrinsic ranking -- re-rank at a fixed VBAT (bench supply) or correct with this curve (Ben).
- [ ] **WS2812/SK6812 latch their last frame** -- firmware must send an explicit all-off on shutdown/sleep or the LEDs stay lit (and keep drawing) with no data; matters for low-power/shipping modes (Ben).

## Battery / solar sourcing

- [x] Qualify a second 32700 sample before committing to the bulk buy -- **DONE
  2026-07-06**: second fullbattery cell delivered 5,752 mAh (+0.5 % vs June's 5,726),
  n=2, 75-unit purchase validated (100 more bought 2026-07-07 -- ADR 0025). The Amazon
  Palowextra "7.2 Ah" alternative measured 5,643 mAh (78 % of label) with 2.3x IR and
  was REJECTED -- see LOG 2026-07-06/07 and
  `docs/tests/BATTERY_32700_SHOOTOUT_REPORT_2026-07-06.html` (Ben/Claude).
- [x] ~~Compare 18650 LiFePO4 sample capacity against rated capacity~~ -- **SUPERSEDED
  2026-07-08**: production format is the 32700 (ADR 0025); the 18650 remains a bench
  cell only (Ben).
- [x] ~~Evaluate 26650 LiFePO4~~ -- **SUPERSEDED**: the open big-cell question is now
  the 20 Ah #6832 for solar-free classes, below (Ben).
- [x] **Bench-test the 20 Ah LFP samples -- CLOSED 2026-07-15 (option cancelled).**
  Sample 1 verified honest 2026-07-12 (19,412 mAh, 97.1% of label; report
  `docs/tests/BATTERY_20AH_UPLIGHT_REPORT_2026-07-12.html`), but batteryspace could
  not supply ~40 cells in time and the Alibaba counterpart (~$4.50/cell bulk!)
  needs ocean freight that misses 2026. The immediate replacement plan was
  hinged-solar-wing + 6 Ah uplights, later superseded by the about-16 trunk-light
  allocation in ADR 0032; sample-2 qualification and the end-cap fixture are moot
  for 2026 -- the Alibaba route is the 2027 lead (Ben).
- [ ] **Qualify the 33140 15 Ah** (new large-hat fleet standard, 130 bought 07-24,
  QUALIFICATION PENDING): full charge->discharge capacity + IR run per the ADR
  0023 recipe (shootout rig; n>=2), then re-derive the dim/off/sleep voltage map
  on the new cell -- the current ADR 0023 tiers are 6 Ah-derived. Gauge:
  DesignCap 15,000 fits under the MAX17260 16,383 cap. Also verify physical fit
  in the large Polycase with panel + board + LED installed (Ben).
  **2026-08-07 sample-1 run:** ET5406A+ moved to COM44 in Nevada City and the
  1.000 A CC / 2.500 V discharge is running under the guarded JSONL logger;
  tooling and test plan are in
  `ops/bench/et5406_discharge.py` and
  `docs/tests/BATTERY_33140_GOTION_ET5406_PLAN_2026-08.md`. After corrected LFP
  charging and an overnight disconnected rest, sample 1 measured 3.362 V by DMM
  / 3.365 V by ET at about 25.6 deg C. Live data:
  `ops/bench/data/ca/2026-08-08-et5406-discharge-041818Z-gotion-33140-15ah-sample-1.jsonl`.
  Finish and analyze sample 1, then repeat sample 2 and derive the threshold map.

  P105/P126 Voltaic ETFE specs captured 2026-06-15 in
  `docs/tests/VOLTAIC_ETFE_PANEL_TEST_PREP_2026-06-15.md`; order/lead-time record now
  lives in `ops/PROCUREMENT.md` (panels bought 2026-06-24).
- [x] ~~Search for round/circular panels~~ -- **CLOSED 2026-07-08**: production panels
  are the rectangular Voltaic ETFE (ADR 0026); round panels dropped for 2026 (Ben).
- [ ] Design hat top so the rectangular production panels mount cleanly with backup
  retention (round-panel accommodation no longer needed) (Steve).

## Custom hardware track

- [x] Decide whether custom board is needed after COTS tests -- **DECIDED 2026-07-08
  (ADR 0024): 2026 production is COTS PowerFeather V2; custom PCBA is the 2027
  option.** Items below apply only if/when that option activates (Ben + Steve).
- [ ] If custom board proceeds, use PowerFeather V2 as reference architecture, with a
  dedicated power-management I2C bus (ADR 0028) and the ADR 0029 LED wiring rules (Ben).
- [ ] Select charger/fuel-gauge/regulator architecture: BQ25628E + MAX17260 + buck-boost is current leading reference (Ben).
- [ ] Keep LED module/daughterboard separate until optics are frozen (Ben + Steve).
- [ ] Add keyed solar connector/pigtail plan; do not rely on direct panel wires to board pads for production (Ben + Steve).
- [ ] Add input protection review for outdoor solar cable (Ben).
- [ ] Add hardware reviewer before any custom board order (Ben).
- [ ] Use PCB-antenna WROOM module by default; do not use u.FL unless RF tests fail (Ben).

## Enclosure track

- [ ] **Integrate the bought COTS enclosures** (strategy update 2026-07-13 --
  hats are purchased boxes now, see `enclosure/README.md`): panel mounting,
  bamboo clamp/attachment, internal mounting for PowerFeather + cell + both LED
  roles, USB-C gasket cutout, ToF windows, strain relief; then thermal/RF proof
  on the real boxes (Steve + Ben).
- [ ] Coordinate the chandelier carpenter box: dimensions for 18 fixtures,
  venting, service access, USB-charging reach (Ben -> Elliot/carpenter).
- [ ] **Design the trunk-light variant** (see `enclosure/README.md`): tree
  attachment, battery/panel arrangement, 4 W RGBW vs lensed 3 W RGB mount and
  protection, and gasketed panel-mount USB-C charge/flash access (Steve + Ben).
- [ ] **ToF apertures**: downward eye port beside the gobo (downlights), outward
  window with protective cover (perimeter hats) (Steve).
- [ ] Add strain-relief plan for panel pigtail / VDC connector (Steve + Ben).
- [ ] Keep antenna region away from solar panel, battery, screws, and metal (Steve + Ben).
- [ ] Decide rope attachment point with team; hybrid primary-hat + secondary-bamboo safety tie remains current recommendation (Ben + Steve).
- [ ] Material test for filter/gobo: matte paint on PLA, translucent PLA, frosted resin (Steve).
- [ ] Thermal test sealed hat in sun/heat with charger and LEDs operating (Ben + Steve).
- [ ] Send hat v1/v2 STL out for MJF evaluation after COTS fit is known (Steve).

## Firmware track

- [ ] **A/B the ESP32-S3 alternative internal RTC sleep source:** compare the current
  default low-frequency RC against `CONFIG_RTC_CLK_SRC_INT_8MD256` on several
  PowerFeathers for actual deep-sleep current, 300/900 s timer error, temperature drift,
  build-toolchain impact, and unchanged radio/power behavior. The documented +5 uA is
  only 0.12 mAh/day, but adopt it only if the measured holdover improvement is real and
  integration stays boring. It may improve rendezvous efficiency; never make POR
  recovery or autonomous correctness depend on it. See the July 13 distributed
  choreography concept note (Ben/Codex).
- [ ] **Prototype rootless fleet phase + future event fabric in `firmware/core/`:** native
  tests first for phase convergence, boot/session IDs, event dedupe/expiry, future
  scheduling, raw-observation freshness, packet loss, duplicates, partitions, stale
  state, random wake phase, and POR reacquisition; then a five-node sleep/rendezvous
  bench. No permanent coordinator. Validate aligned wake collision behavior and measure
  residual event skew before selecting an algorithm (Ben/Codex).
- [ ] **Build the production behavior layer as a generic distributed choreography
  runtime, not a CA-only engine:** exercise at least one CA, one deterministic scheduled
  timeline, one spatial solenoid/light ripple, and one distributed presence-triggered
  easter egg through the same program/event interface. Bridge control is an expiring
  overlay for DJ shows/diagnostics/registration; bridge loss returns to autonomous
  operation; local power policy always wins. Design space and phased validation:
  `docs/research/AUTONOMOUS_DISTRIBUTED_CHOREOGRAPHY_CONCEPT_2026-07-13.md` (Ben/Codex).
- [ ] Create board definitions for `powerfeather_v2` and the possible `resonance_custom` target (bake-off boards retired -- ADR 0016 annotation) (Ben).
- [ ] Implement telemetry abstraction for charger/fuel gauge / battery monitor (Ben).
- [ ] Implement LED driver abstraction per ADR 0029 roles: SK6812/WS2812 via NeoPixelBus (3V3 rail) + 4 W RGBW point source (VBAT-direct); no I2C LED controllers (Ben).
- [ ] Implement LED rail power abstraction (`VSQT`, onboard LED LDO, external rail enable) (Ben).
- [ ] Implement standard OTA maintenance mode; no ESP-NOW firmware chunks (Ben).
- [~] Add an autonomous low-VBAT park/cutoff policy for ordinary net_bench/production
  COMMS mode. **FIRST NET_BENCH PASS DONE 2026-06-30:** `--field-cycle` in
  `net-bench-2026-06-30.4` adds a production-ish solar day / radio-night lifecycle:
  charge-sleep on supply, wait-dark, always-awake 1 Hz radio drawdown, then protect
  timer-sleep at the LFP floor. Deployed to `9E5AB8` and logging to
  `ops/bench/data/ca/2026-06-30-ca-field-cycle-9E5AB8.jsonl`. Remaining: analyze the
  first full cycle, tune full/taper and cutoff thresholds, then port the proven policy
  into production firmware (Ben/Codex). **THRESHOLDS NOW MEASURED (2026-07-07): use
  ADR 0023's tiers (standard: dim 3.00 / off 2.95 / sleep 2.90 under full load) -- the
  current field-cycle floors (3.10/3.00) strand capacity; hysteresis + coulomb-primary
  hybrid requirements are in the ADR.**
- [ ] Implement the ADR 0023 low-battery state machine in field-cycle/production
  firmware: latched dim/off/sleep transitions with 60 s confirm + >=150 mV re-entry
  hysteresis, load-compensated voltage (`bv + 0.15 x I_A`), coulomb-remaining primary
  (DesignCap ~5750, gauge current /1.08), voltage tiers as backstop, watchdogged
  sleep (Ben/Claude).
  - [ ] Add the missing LED-off state. Current field-cycle treats confirmed 2.95 V as
    `FC_PROTECT` and immediately timer-sleeps; ADR 0023 calls for LEDs off with
    duty-cycled OTA reachability until the separate 2.90 V sparse-sleep threshold.
    This did not cause P105's July 11 early POR failure at about 3.04 V, but it leaves
    the 2.95-to-2.90 V reserve unused in a clean run. (Codex)
  - [~] Make low-VBAT protection survive rail-collapse/POR loops. P105 `9F26F8`
    produced 31 `poweron` resets in about 19 minutes on 2026-07-11 while the HEX load
    held VBAT near 3.0 V; every hard reset erased the RTC cycle state and in-RAM 60 s
    debounce, then boot re-enabled the load. **P105 FIX DEPLOYED 2026-07-12:**
    `net-bench-2026-07-12.1` persists idle/full/dim/protect session stages before
    rail-on. A POR from full consumes one staged retry at dim brightness; a POR from
    dim or protect hard-parks until verified charge. The exact P105 artifact is
    `build/field-cycle-peer-20260712-p105-dusk-dim-retry-r3/net_bench.ino.bin` with
    dim 3.10 V / 10 s, low 2.95 V / 60 s, and critical 2.90 V immediate. OTA ack,
    explicit `/resume`, ESP-NOW rejoin, and one natural five-minute charge-sleep wake
    are verified. Remaining: validate tonight's real dim/POR behavior; optionally
    induce one full-stage reset and a second dim-stage reset under supervision. The
    The original P126 peer remained on `.1`; replacement `9F2690` received `.3` by USB
    on July 13 and now carries the same durable reset/protect logic. Hardware fault
    injection during its lighter three-pixel load remains unvalidated. (Ben/Codex)
  - [x] **Keep externally powered, battery-absent fixtures serviceable even when
    PROTECT was persisted -- DONE 2026-08-08:** a persisted PROTECT stage now keeps
    rails parked but does not timer-sleep while a good external supply is present
    and no plausible battery voltage exists. A guarded serial `X` clear additionally
    requires PowerFeather readiness, charging off, >=4.5 V good supply, no BQ fault,
    and no plausible attached battery. Removing external power restores the normal
    sleep decision. Native regression coverage and production-board `9E5A94` both
    pass; the latter recovered over USB with its BAT and VDC ports empty (Ben/Codex).
- [~] Replace the field-cycle dusk/dawn shortcut with the ADR 0031 scheduled production
  gate. Current net_bench enters draw from local panel/lux classification:
  `fieldCycleSupplyPresent()` requires `csV >= 4.0 V` plus useful input/charge current
  >=20 mA; TSL2591 peers use five minutes at <=200 lux and >=500 lux for dawn; bare
  peers use 30 minutes without useful input. These remain useful bench classifiers, but
  clouds, shade, panel angle, charge taper, or moving a fixture can still start early,
  and bare peers have produced 13-15 h shows. Production should wake before a versioned
  UTC transition, reacquire time from sparse GPS/RTC anchors, start/stop on schedule,
  and expose source/age/uncertainty. Panel/lux telemetry becomes a sanity check and
  optional explicitly bounded degraded-mode input. Exact invalid-time fallback remains
  open; it must not silently recreate the artificial long show. (Ben/Codex).
  - [x] **Confirmed failure mode 2026-07-11/12:** charge termination drives both
    `supply_ma` and `battery_ma` below 20 mA while panel voltage remains high, so the
    peer declares false dark, pulses the LED load, then declares sunrise when current
    returns. This produced dozens of false P105 cycles and repeatedly reset coulomb
    counters. Addressed for P105 by the qualified 200/500 lux gate above; the bare-peer
    fallback uses a 30-minute confirm rather than panel voltage, which remains high at
    zero current. (Codex)
- [ ] Optional backlog: one cold-night discharge at a representative dim load to
  sharpen ADR 0023's tiers for winter (they're currently 79.9 deg F, n=2 data;
  conservative tier is the hedge until then) (Ben).
- [ ] Analyze first `--field-cycle` run for `9E5AB8`: confirm 5-minute charge wakes,
  charge recovery from ~2.67 V on USB/solar, full-ish detection, transition to dark
  drawdown, protect cutoff reason/voltage, and mAh/Wh accounting quality. Data:
  `ops/bench/data/ca/2026-06-30-ca-field-cycle-9E5AB8.jsonl` (Ben/Codex).
- [~] Add BQ25628E charger-state telemetry to `net_bench` and production telemetry:
  charge state, VBUS/source state, `CHG_EN`, `EN_HIZ`, BATFET control, input/charge
  faults, VINDPM/IINDPM, and effective charge-current limit. This is now important
  for interpreting low-VBAT solar/USB rescue: on 2026-06-30 a 5 V Anker bank was
  masked while solar held the input near 6.2 V; after solar removal USB worked but
  charged slowly at `supply_v=4.887`, `supply_ma=92`, `battery_ma=38`, likely due
  to 4.8 V solar VINDPM and/or low-VBAT precharge. Consider an automatic USB-rescue
  VINDPM policy around 4.6 V when the input is a 5 V bank rather than a panel
  (Ben/Codex). **NET_BENCH DONE 2026-06-30 in `.7`:** heartbeat/dashboard/logger now
  expose BQ VINDPM/ICHG/VREG plus raw control/status/fault registers and decoded
  `CHG_EN`, `EN_HIZ`, BATFET, VBUS, and charge-state bits. First USB-rescue sample:
  `bqv=4800`, `bqichg=1480`, `bqvreg=3600`, `CHG_EN=1`, `HIZ=0`, BATFET normal,
  VBUS adapter, charge-state CC bucket, `fault0=0`. Remaining: port to production
  telemetry and decide whether to add automatic USB-rescue VINDPM behavior.
- [ ] **WiFi re-associate guard (cheap roaming):** the ESP32 latches one Eero BSSID and won't auto-roam (no 802.11k/v/r -- LOG cont. 9, POWERFEATHER_NOTES). On link-loss / low-RSSI in maintenance mode, do `WiFi.disconnect()` + `WiFi.begin()` to re-pick the strongest beacon. Low field priority (deployed fixtures are stationary; the maintenance-OTA path already does a fresh `WiFi.begin`) -- but a belt-and-suspenders guard for OTA windows (Ben).
- [~] Implement ESP-NOW heartbeat/state packets with jitter and sequence numbers -- done in `firmware/net_bench/` (feasibility); port the validated packet/PDR design into production `core/packet` after the matrix run (Ben).
- [ ] Implement low-battery modes: dim, LED hard-off, shipping mode (Ben).
- [ ] **Revisit 8-bit LED low-end dimming for the ambient look** (deferred 2026-06-07): WS2812/SK6812 are 8-bit/channel, so gamma-on dims to OFF below ~brightness 24 (the ambient "~10%" spec sits in this dead-zone); gamma-off gives ultra-dim but non-linear steps. Options: dim-floor `max(1,gamma8(x))`, gentler gamma, gamma-on-color-only, or temporal dithering. See LOG 2026-06-07 + `firmware/POWERFEATHER_NOTES.md` (Ben).
- [ ] **Use the switchable 3V3 rail (GPIO4) as the LED kill-switch** in production firmware (`digitalWrite(4,LOW)` = LEDs off, can't drain the pack) -- folds into the pixel-power-architecture decision (option a). See `firmware/POWERFEATHER_NOTES.md` (Ben).
- [x] Implement watchdog/reset-reason/brownout logging -- DONE in `firmware/net_bench/` (esp_task_wdt + `--wdt-hangtest`); **validated 2026-06-07**: induced hang -> auto-reset -> `reset_reason=task_watchdog`, no human. Port to production firmware (Ben).
- [ ] Implement field telemetry logging schema for BM 2026 -> 2027 design data (Ben).
- [ ] Port `TalismanPatterns.cpp` into `firmware/core/pattern/` (Ben).
- [ ] Implement minimum-viable CA tick + render loop on bench as the first program
  family within the generic choreography runtime; compare generation-based and
  intentionally asynchronous updates rather than assuming one model (Ben).

## Production test / flashing

- [x] NC 4th PowerFeather enumeration -- RESOLVED 2026-08-06: it is now present
  as COM25 / `68:EE:8F:F4:02:F4`. It was not reflashed; the dedicated CoreS3
  `E39F1C` on COM40 now owns the desk-bridge role. (Ben/Codex)
- [x] CoreS3 standalone power check -- RESOLVED 2026-08-06: Ben removed the
  ESP32-H2 Gateway module and DIN base, and the dedicated CoreS3 bridge booted
  normally from its own USB-C connection. The earlier no-boot symptom is not
  reproducible after the bridge flash. (Ben/Codex)
- [ ] CoreS3 bridge receive/control proof: return one PowerFeather to channel-11
  `fixture` or `net_bench` peer firmware, confirm its heartbeat appears on the
  CoreS3 screen/dashboard, then run one harmless targeted identify or maintenance
  command and verify receipt. TX-only and dashboard parsing passed 2026-08-06;
  the connected perimeter trio currently runs WiFi-only LED Studio. (Ben/Codex)
- [ ] Trio OTA: endpoint GET verified on all 3 NC perimeter lights
  (led-studio-2026-08-01.3); run one full artifact POST /update cycle to
  exercise the real path before the boards go battery-only (Ben).
- [~] Fleet-wide: retire WonkyHouse and BubbyNet from production images and use
  the exact case-sensitive `Party In The Woods` SSID. Port the dual-SSID pattern
  from led_studio only if it remains useful; neither legacy bench SSID belongs on
  a production peer. `net_bench/build.sh` already rejects WonkyHouse unless Dad's
  legacy personal bench explicitly opts in, but `fixture` inherited stale local
  credentials into the Aug-8 artifact and the 24-unit correction is now P0 above.
  Still open: validate the planned virtual `Party In The Woods` SSID across both
  camp and art-site Starlinks, including channel behavior, before field reliance
  (Ben + Codex).
- [ ] Keep USB/pogo flashing as mandatory recovery path even if COTS boards support USB-C (Ben).
- [ ] Investigate JLCPCB / PCBWay firmware pre-flash only for custom-PCBA path (Ben).
- [ ] Write smoke-test host script: node ID, firmware version, battery, charge/fault, reset reason, peer count (Ben).
- [ ] Define production acceptance checklist for each fixture (Ben + Steve).

## Coordination with project team

- [ ] Confirm timing for Bamboo Pure air-ship of prototype lanterns to Steve in TN (Ben -> Elliot / Dipta).
- [ ] Align with Elliot on rope-attachment decision (Ben).
- [ ] Confirm hat OD / height / bamboo-overlap to Vishnu so he can finalize renders (Ben).
- [x] ~~Pull `INV_2026_00401`, decompose cost, compare to COTS/custom BOMs~~ --
  **RETIRED 2026-07-08**: the invoice's identity is unclear (probably the Bamboo
  Pure lantern invoice, possibly the early custom-PCBA quote), and with real COTS
  procurement recorded in `ops/PROCUREMENT.md` the comparison baseline is no longer
  useful (Ben).
- [ ] Clarify chandelier-light scope/ownership with Elliot + Vishnu (18 lights,
  internals fungible with the fleet -- ADR 0032) and decide the exact HEX/RGBW mix
  (Ben).
- [ ] Decide the TENTATIVE TN trip (~3rd-4th week of July): fleet-scale test of the
  ~70 boards at Steve's -- production-firmware mesh lighting effects + presence
  detection, indoors if enclosures aren't ready; back for the Aug 1-2 container
  unload (Ben + Steve).
- [ ] Get Steve on project's official core build team wiki (Ben -> Elliot).
- [ ] Get shared access to Co-Work's wiki folder once cloud-hosted (Ben -> Elliot).
- [ ] Drop lighting workstream digest into WhatsApp -- the 2026-07-08 team write-up
  (`docs/`) is the candidate artifact (Ben).

## Gobo pattern program (community submissions PULLED 2026-07-08)

The community Mandala submission program was pulled for time. Current plan: in-house
designs + generative-AI-modulated bamboo-leaf patterns per bamboo species in the tree
(BACKGROUND.md has the full record). Surviving work items:

- [ ] Generate/curate the in-house + bamboo-leaf pattern set (Ben + Steve + Vishnu).
- [ ] When Steve's printable "Resonance Tree" gobo source lands, measure the
  thinnest connected solid web and the smallest surviving aperture from its native
  geometry; record the nozzle, material, slicer profile, and print orientation; then
  use those proven dimensions as the generative validator baseline (Ben + Steve +
  Codex).
- [ ] Pipeline: pattern -> vectorize -> constraint check -> cone projection -> STL
  (unchanged from the original program design).
- [ ] Brightness normalization in firmware or per-filter metadata.
- [ ] Cataloging schema (per-fixture pattern identity -- useful regardless of source).
- [ ] Print schedule backward from ~Aug 10 filters-in-hand (Steve's Bambu + possible
  batch service).

## Solar layout levers (solarsim studies, 2026-07-20/21)

- [~] **Hinged downlight panels -- NOT ADOPTED for the 72 large enclosures**
  (Ben + Steve, 2026-07-24); the trunk lights DO get a hinged "wing" (per-light
  optimal angles in the rotation-sweep data). Downlight harvest reverts to the
  FLAT baseline (550 Wh fleet, worst ~3.4 Wh, 6 lights under 3 h full runtime) --
  re-check the power-budget note's show floor against flat numbers. Study kept
  for the record: tangential bracket+hinge (pitch-only) measured
  +15.7% fleet solar (free-azimuth ideal +25.3%); two-family install rule (pitch
  outward ~40 deg, northern arc inward ~30) needs no per-unit config; a ONE-rule
  aesthetic variant (uniform outward 30 deg) measured +10.7% (-4.4% vs optimal,
  cost concentrated in the north arc: -27%, 5 lights back under 3 h). Blockers to
  resolve: whole-lantern tilt would wreck the gobo projection (wants a panel-only
  flap -- Steve); no-spin harness freezes RF panel azimuths at KNOWN radial angles
  -- run the frozen-radial arm in ops/locate before committing (data + figures in
  ops/solarsim/data). HARNESS CANDIDATE (Ben + Steve, 2026-07-22): V-hang between
  adjacent attach points, two ropes to the polycase short-edge lips (3 holes each,
  already there) -- solves anti-spin + keeps rope shade off the panel (the lit^2 x
  0.75 mismatch penalty makes even a thin center-rope shadow expensive; unmodeled
  in the sim). Simulated between-limbs positions: solar-NEUTRAL (+0.8% hinged,
  -1.0% flat; middle ring +7%, inner -3%) -- the roof weave dominates occlusion,
  not the limbs, so the V-hang is justified mechanically, not by harvest
  (Ben + Steve).
- [ ] **Inner ring at 3.26 m** (middle equidistant): +28% inner-ring solar, fixes
  gobo spacing; door-axis finding: treev4 tunnels sit at az 75.4/255.4 (rotated
  14.6 deg CCW, near-sunrise-aligned) -- reconcile orientation + door lights with
  Elliot; rise/set chord can NEVER hit both doors (non-antipodal), belly crossings
  at ~07:25/~18:25 are the symmetric photo-op (Ben -> Elliot).
